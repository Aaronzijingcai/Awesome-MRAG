Latinos are optimistic about their finances in the next year and upward economic mobility for their children Most Hispanics are confident their finances will improve in the next year and also see a bright financial future for their children. Those already prospering are the most likely to be optimistic in their expectations about the next year. Looking ahead, optimism about their family’s future economic prospects has risen faster among Latinos than in the population as a whole. The share of Latinos who expect their family finances to improve “a lot” or “some” in the coming year is up 14 percentage points, from 67% in 2008 – during the Great Recession – and in 2011 to 81% in 2015.

A total of 679 respondents (45%) were surveyed in Spanish, and 821 respondents (55%) were interviewed in English. Any person ages 18 or older who said he or she was of Latino origin or descent was eligible to complete the survey. To ensure the highest possible coverage of the eligible population, the study employed a dual- frame landline/cellular telephone design. The sample consisted of a landline sampling frame (yielding 449 completed interviews) and a cellphone sampling frame (1,051 interviews).4 Both the landline and cellphone sampling frames used a stratified sampling design, oversampling areas with higher densities of Latino residents. Overall the study employed six strata. Landline and cellphone samples were provided by Marketing Systems Group (MSG). For the landline sampling frame, the sample was compared with InfoUSA and Experian landline household databases, and phone numbers associated with households that included persons with Samples for the low-incidence landline and low-incidence cell strata were drawn from previously interviewed respondents in SSRS’s weekly dual-frame Excel omnibus survey.

Overall, Hispanics with a positive view of their current financial situation are significantly more likely than those who rate their economic circumstances as only fair or poor to say their family’s finances will improve over the next 12 months. Among the 40% of Hispanics who say they are in excellent or good shape financially, a third believe that their family’s financial situation will improve a lot in the next year while about half (56%) say they expect some advancement.

About seven-in-ten (72%) Hispanic adults expect their children will be better off financially than they themselves are, while 16% expect their children’s financial situation will be about the same as theirs. At the same time, 75% of immigrant adults and 70% of U.S.-born adults expect their children will be better off. Views also differ by age, with older Latinos more pessimistic about their children’s financial futures than younger Latinos. Among those ages 65 and older, 52% say their children will be better off than themselves. By comparison, 75% of Latinos ages 18 to 29 have similar expectations of their children, as do 76% of those ages 30 to 49 and 70% of those ages 50 to 64. Among those ages 65 and older, 13% say their children will be less well off, higher than among Latinos ages 18 to 29 and 30 to 49. 14 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org upbeat about their short-term economic future than were younger and middle-aged Hispanics. About six-in-ten Latinos 65 years old or older (59%) say they expect their family’s finances to improve “a lot” or “some” in the coming year, an increase of 7 percentage points since 2008. By contrast, nine-in-ten Hispanic adults under the age of 30 expect their financial condition to get better, a 13-point rise. The gains in economic optimism are similarly large among Latinos ages 30 to 49 and 50 to 64 (+16 points for each group).

By contrast, gains in perceptions of economic well-being among Latinos 65 years old or older were more modest, standing at 37% in 2015. These differences by age are the exception, not the rule, as similar-sized gains are recorded among most other demographic subgroups. For example, ratings of personal finances rose by 17 percentage points among U.S.-born Hispanics and by 18 points among those born in another country. Positive views of economic well-being rose by 16 percentage points among Latino men and by 18 points among Latina women. These rosy assessments also increased by double digits among those with less than a high school education (+12 points) and high school graduates (+16) as well as those who had attended college (+17).

Latinos are increasingly positive about current finances, but many say family income is not keeping pace with cost of living The share of Latinos who rate their personal finances as “excellent” or “good” has nearly doubled since the Great Recession, and this growing optimism extends across nearly all Latino demographic subgroups. However, half of Latinos say their family income is not keeping up with the cost of living. Overall four-in-ten Hispanics say their personal financial situation is in “excellent” (8%) or “good” (33%) shape, according to the latest Pew Research Center National Survey of Latinos. Still, a substantial majority (59%) describe their financial condition as “only fair” (47%) or “poor” (12%). The latest results contrast sharply with those in November 2008, in the midst of the Great Recession, when only 4% of Latinos reported that they were in excellent financial shape and 5 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Despite growing confidence and a larger economic footprint, federal government data shows a mixed economic picture for the Hispanic community recently. For example, the group’s unemployment rate has improved since the Great Recession (just as it has for all Americans), falling from a high of 12.8% in the first quarter of 2010 to 6.4% in the last quarter of 2015 (and 5.6% in the first quarter of 2016).3 Still, it remains above its low of 5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is higher than that for non-Hispanic workers in the fourth quarter of 2015. At the same time, median household income for Hispanics has stagnated since the Great Recession—in 2014 it was $42,491, a level essentially unchanged since the Great Recession (income is also little changed among the U.S. public), according to the latest Census Bureau data.

Trump’s job rating among independents, like his overall rating, breaks down along partisan lines. His rating among GOP-leaning independents (72% in 2017, 69% in 2018) was not markedly different from Obama’s and Clinton’s ratings among Democratic-leaning independents during their first two years in office (though much lower than Bush’s among Republican leaners).

In fact, his rating members of the opposing party – was much lower than recent presidents’. In fact, his rating among Democratic-leaning independents during his first two years was about as low as his rating among Democrats (7% in 2017, 9% in 2018).

Among those who identified as Republicans, just 40% favored same-sex marriage, while 54% were opposed. In contrast to Republicans, Republican-leaning independents favored same-sex marriage (58% were in favor, 37% were opposed). Support for same- sex marriage was higher among Democratic-leaning independents than among Democrats (82% vs. 73%).

Among the public overall, 17% are Democratic-leaning independents, while 13% lean toward the Republican Party. Just 7% of Americans decline to lean toward a party, a share that has changed little in recent years. This is a long-standing dynamic that has been the subject of past analyses, both by Pew Research Center and others. In their political attitudes and views of most issues, independents who lean toward a party are in general agreement with those who affiliate with the same party. For example, Republican-leaning independents are less supportive of Donald Trump than are Republican identifiers. Still, about since 2000, when moderates outnumbered liberals, 50% to 30%.

In the one-shot demonstration, we use the special token [NA] to represent the “Not Appli- cable Citations” for conscious incompetence. We deliberately omit some knowledge in the demon- stration example knowledge graph, and we insert [NA] tokens in the corresponding sentences that use these knowledge within the example answer. 4 Evaluation Metrics We build a baseline to enable LLMs to generate knowledge-aware attributed answers. Following the approach of many retrieval augmented gener- ation works (Lee et al., 2022; Izacard and Grave, 2021), we utilize a pipeline consisting of three com- ponents: retrieval, re-ranking, and generation. 3.1 Retrieval Our baseline retrieval process consists of two parts: named entity recognition and graph retrieval. We utilize spaCy3 to identify the named entities men- tioned in the question. Using these entities, we retrieve entity-centered sub-graphs using SPARQL. For each retrieved entity, we search for nodes in the graph that match the entity’s name. We use the named entity recognition (NER) entity type as a simple filter (e.g., the NER category “person” matches the “human” entity type in WikiData). Tak- ing each selected node as the center, we retrieve one-hop sub-graphs that contain properties associ- ated with the entity. 3.2 Re-ranking The re-ranking component plays a crucial role in to the input format of the LLMs, we transform the structured KGs into flat texts. We preserve the information of the retrieved sub-graphs by map- ping each sub-graph to a set of triples. Each triple consists of two nodes and one edge, where one node is the centered entity, the other node is its neighbor, and the edge represents the relationship between them. For example, [Q212657 - place of birth - Q220] can be translated to [Artemisia Gen- tileschi - place of birth - Rome]. In this translation, we use the names of the entities for better com- prehension by both the models and humans, since WikiData utilizes QIDs (e.g., Q220) to represent unique entities. We construct a prompt (Table 13 in appendix D) which includes 1) instruction to the models to generate attributed answers. 2) re- trieved knowledge graph, and 3) the question. We employ one-shot in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020) by prepending one human written demon- stration. In the one-shot demonstration, we use ated with the entity. 3.2 Re-ranking The re-ranking component plays a crucial role in disambiguating retrieved entities, as multiple en- tities may share the same name in the WikiData graph. Two common scenarios are different indi- viduals with the same name (e.g., Anne Hathaway the American actress and Anne Hathaway the wife of William Shakespeare) and different references 3https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer to the same word (e.g., “Chinese” the language and “Chinese” the ethnic group). When multiple entities are retrieved from the graph for a given entity name, we rank the graphs based on the Exact Match (EM) between the neighboring nodes and the question. We select the entity with the highest number of matched neighboring nodes. 3.3 Generation The generation component effectively prompt the LLMs with the retrieved knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate answers that attribute the KG. To adapt to the input format of the LLMs, we transform the\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: In figure 1, which relation arrows do not point to specific leaf nodes?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

Evaluation Criteria: Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence whereby the answer should be well-structured and well-organized. The answer should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic. Evaluation Steps: 1. Read the questions carefully and identify the main topic and key points. 2. Read the answer and compare it to the question. Check if the answer covers the main topic and key points of the question, and if it presents them in a clear and logical order. 3.

A Dataset Construction In this section, we will explain the detailed process and algorithms for the automatic dataset construc- tion pipeline. Using this pipeline, we are able to construct datasets with a greater scale or in other domains. A.1 Person Selection To improve the complexity of the questions and dif- ficulty to LLMs, we involve more than one person in each question. In addition, we need high qual- ity paragraphs for subsequent dataset generation steps. Therefore, we utilize name pairs and para- graphs from the biographical database, which is a database specifically designed for the relation ex- be partially verified by the knowledge graph G. [NA] is not a citation on conventional means, but a indicator of knowledge gap. 2.2 Dataset Construction Each entry of dataset bioKaLMA includes two questions and a minimum knowledge set. The two questions enquire about the same people on similar aspects of their life stories. The minimum knowl- edge set is the smallest set of knowledge that is required to answer each question. One question is a general version and the other is specific. The general questions are more concise and natural for human readers, and the specific version questions have a tighter bond to the minimum knowledge set, and is hence more accurate for evaluating LLMs. An example data piece is shown in Table 1. We construct the dataset using an automatic pipeline consisting of three steps: Person Selection, Name Disambiguation, and Evolutionary Question Generation. In the first two steps, we use SPARQL queries to select related people from human written queries to select related people from human written sentences and identify their identity in WikiData. In the third step, we iteratively construct paragraph and question about the selected people. The first iteration starts with a human written sentence about the selected people. In each next iteration, we apply a data selection algorithm to select an appropriate knowledge from WikiData based on the existing paragraph, and extend the paragraph to include the additional knowledge using LLM. Then, LLM constructs the questions using the final paragraph as an answer. The general and specific questions are generated with different prompts and demon- strations. All the selected knowledge from each iteration form the “minimum knowledge set” for the question. While we use the human biography domain as an example, this method is applicable to all domains. We present the details of the data construction in Appendix A. 2.3 Dataset Analysis Statistics There are 1,085 data entries in concise and understandable by human readers. 4) Significance: The generated question should be meaningful and helpful to users. To our best knowledge, there is no perfect au- tomatic evaluation for these metrics. Naturalness and significance are subjective. Hence, we apply human evaluation to ensure the dataset quality. We randomly sample 50 data entries from entire evaluation process does not require human annotated ground truth. To implement the above innovations, we first design an automatic dataset construction pipeline. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset1 in the biographical domain, namely BioKaLMA, for a benchmark with all-rounded automatic measure- ments. Biography forms a good test-set for attri- bution due to its practical application and conve- nient evaluation. The availability of high-quality knowledge graph like WikiData also benefits our dataset construction. Derived from the biograph- 1The codes and dataset BioKaLMA are publicly available in https://github.com/lixinze777/ Knowledge-aware-Language-Model-Attribution ical database2 (Plum et al., 2022) and WikiData, BioKaLMA contains 1,085 data entries. Each data entry includes question and knowledge required to answer the question.

We compare the context retrieved by RAP- TOR with the context retrieved by Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR). Figure 4 in the main paper details the retrieval process within RAPTOR’s tree structure for two questions. The nodes that RAPTOR selects for each question are highlighted, while the leaf nodes that DPR selects for the same question are indicated with arrows. This comparison illustrates the advantage of RAPTOR’s tree structure. RAPTOR selects nodes from different layers depending on the level of granularity required by the 18 Layers Queried / Start Layer Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes) Layer 1 1 layer 94.7 84.2 2 layers - 89.4 Table 17: Performance of RAPTOR when querying different layers of the tree for Story 5. Layers Queried / Start Layer Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes) Layer 1 1 layer 57.9 47.3 2 layers - 68.4 I.2 W HICH LAYERS DO RETRIEVED NODES COME FROM ? We further conduct an ablation study across all three datasets and across three different retrievers with RAPTOR with the collapsed tree retrieval to examine the layers from which the retrieved nodes originate. We observe that between 18.5% to 57% of the retrieved nodes come from non-leaf nodes. As illustrated in Figure 7, the retrieval pattern across layers reveals the importance of RAPTOR’s multi-layered tree structure. Notably, a significant percentage of the nodes retrieved by RAPTOR using the DPR retriever for the NarrativeQA dataset come from the first and second layers of the Wu et al. (2021), which also employs UnifiedQA, RAPTOR outperforms it on all metrics. While Wu et al. (2021) rely solely on the summary in the top root node of the tree structure, RAPTOR benefits from its intermediate layers and clustering approaches, which allows it to capture a range of information, from general themes to specific details, contributing to its overall strong performance. 4.1 C ONTRIBUTION OF THE TREE STRUCTURE We examine the contribution of each layer of nodes to RAPTOR’s retrieval capabilities. We hy- pothesized that upper nodes play a crucial role in handling thematic or multi-hop queries requiring a broader understanding of the text. 8 of hallucinations, refer to the appendix E. Querying In this section, we elaborate on the two querying mechanisms employed by RAPTOR: tree traversal and collapsed tree. These methods offer unique ways of traversing the multi-layered RAPTOR tree to retrieve relevant information, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. We provide the pseudocode of both methods in Appendix F. Note that we embed all nodes using SBERT. The tree traversal method first selects the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine retrieval corpora. During the query phase, RAPTOR leverages this tree structure for more effective retrieval. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that RAPTOR not only outperforms traditional retrieval methods but also sets new performance benchmarks on several question-answering tasks. 9\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: In figure 4, which nodes are retrieved by RAPTOR for both questions?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

Our controlled experiments demonstrated that RAPTOR not only outperforms traditional retrieval methods but also sets new performance benchmarks on several question-answering tasks. 9 of hallucinations, refer to the appendix E. Querying In this section, we elaborate on the two querying mechanisms employed by RAPTOR: tree traversal and collapsed tree. These methods offer unique ways of traversing the multi-layered RAPTOR tree to retrieve relevant information, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. We provide the pseudocode of both methods in Appendix F. Note that we embed all nodes using SBERT.

We compare the context retrieved by RAP- TOR with the context retrieved by Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR). Figure 4 in the main paper details the retrieval process within RAPTOR’s tree structure for two questions. The nodes that RAPTOR selects for each question are highlighted, while the leaf nodes that DPR selects for the same question are indicated with arrows. This comparison illustrates the advantage of RAPTOR’s tree structure.

Our algorithm varies n neighbors to create a hierar- chical clustering structure: it first identifies global clusters and then performs local clustering within these global clusters. This two-step clustering process captures a broad spectrum of relationships among the text data, from broad themes to specific details. Should a local cluster’s combined context ever exceed the summarization model’s token threshold, our algorithm recursively applies clustering within the cluster, ensuring that the context remains within the token threshold. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection. BIC not only penalizes model complexity but also rewards goodness of fit (Schwarz, 1978). The BIC for a given GMM is BIC = ln(N)k − 2 ln(ˆL), where N is the number nodes at each level.

Our clustering algorithm is based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), an approach that offers both flexibility and a probabilistic framework. GMMs assume that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. 3 (Schwarz, 1978). The BIC for a given GMM is BIC = ln(N)k − 2 ln(ˆL), where N is the number of text segments (or data points), k is the number of model parameters, and ˆL is the maximized value of the likelihood function of the model. In the context of GMM, the number of parameters k is a function of the dimensionality of the input vectors and the number of clusters. With the optimal number of clusters determined by BIC, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is then used to estimate the GMM parameters, namely the means, covariances, and mixture weights. While the Gaussian assumption in GMMs may not perfectly align with the nature of text data, which often exhibits a sparse and skewed distribution, our empirical observations suggest that it offers an effective model for our purpose. We run an ablation comparing GMM Clustering with summarizing contiguous chunks and provide details in Appendix B. Model-Based Summarization After clustering the nodes using Gaussian Mixture Models, the and summarizing contiguous text chunks. We determined the window size for this setup based on the average cluster size observed in RAPTOR, which is approximately 6.7 nodes. Hence, we chose a window size of 7 nodes. The collapsed tree approach was applied for retrieval in both models. B.2 R ESULTS & DISCUSSION The results of the ablation study are presented in table 9. The results from this ablation study clearly indicate an improvement in accuracy when employing RAPTOR’s clustering mechanism over the recency-based tree approach. This finding substantiates our hypothesis that the clustering strategy in RAPTOR is more effective in capturing homogeneous content for summarization, thereby enhancing the overall retrieval performance. 16\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: What model is the clustering algorithm of this paper based on, and what presents a challenge to it?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

Continue this process recursively for d layers, producing sets S1, S2, . . . , Sd. 6. Concatenate sets S1 through Sd to assemble the relevant context to the query. By adjusting the depth d and the number of nodes k selected at each layer, the tree traversal method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved. The algorithm starts with a broad outlook by considering the top layers of the tree and progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers. The collapsed tree approach offers a simpler way to search for relevant information by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously, as depicted in Figure 2. Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. The steps for this method are outlined below: 1. First, collapse the entire RAPTOR tree into a single layer.

At each level, it retrieves the top- k node(s) from the child nodes of the previous layer’s top-k. Collapsed tree collapses the tree into a single layer and retrieves nodes until a threshold number of tokens is reached, based on cosine similarity to the query vector.

Additionally, we anticipate future directions for RAG, emphasizing potential enhancements to tackle current challenges. The paper unfolds as follows: Section II introduces the main concept and current paradigms of RAG. The following three sections explore core components—“Retrieval”, “Gen- eration” and “Augmentation”, respectively. Section III focuses on optimization methods in retrieval,including indexing, query and embedding optimization. Section IV concentrates on post- retrieval process and LLM fine-tuning in generation.

The burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth, yet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that could clarify its broader trajectory. This survey endeavors to fill this gap by mapping out the RAG process and charting its evolution and anticipated future paths, with a focus on the integration of RAG within LLMs. This paper considers both technical paradigms and research methods, summarizing three main research paradigms from over 100 RAG studies, and analyzing key technologies in the core stages of “Retrieval,” “Generation,” and “Augmentation.” On the other hand, current research tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and summarization of how to evaluate RAG. This paper compre- hensively reviews the downstream tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methods applicable to RAG. Overall, this paper sets out to meticulously compile and categorize the foundational technical concepts, historical progression, and 2 Fig. 1. Technology tree of RAG research. The stages of involving RAG mainly include pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. With the emergence of LLMs, research on RAG initially focused on leveraging the powerful in context learning abilities of LLMs, primarily concentrating on the inference stage. Subsequent research has delved deeper, gradually integrating more with the fine-tuning of LLMs. Researchers have also been exploring ways to enhance language models in the pre-training stage through retrieval-augmented techniques. advanced RAG, and modular RAG. This review contex- tualizes the broader scope of RAG research within the landscape of LLMs. • We identify and discuss the central technologies integral to the RAG process, specifically focusing on the aspects of “Retrieval”, “Generation” and “Augmentation”, and delve into their synergies, elucidating how these com- ponents intricately collaborate to form a cohesive and effective RAG framework.

In this approach, the retriever module is directly substituted to gen- erate relevant documents according to a query. This method assists in addressing the difficulties encountered during the fine-tuning process and enhances model performance. IV. G ENERATION After retrieval, it is not a good practice to directly input all the retrieved information to the LLM for answering questions. Following will introduce adjustments from two perspectives: adjusting the retrieved content and adjusting the LLM. A. Context Curation Redundant information can interfere with the final gener- ation of LLM, and overly long contexts can also lead LLM to the “Lost in the middle” problem [98]. Like humans, LLM tends to only focus on the beginning and end of long texts, while forgetting the middle portion. Therefore, in the RAG system, we typically need to further process the retrieved content. [27] X. V . Lin, X. Chen, M. Chen, W. Shi, M. Lomeli, R. James, P. Ro- driguez, J. Kahn, G. Szilvasy, M.

This includes checking for very high rates of leaving questions blank, as well as always selecting the first or last answer presented. As a result of this checking, one ATP respondent was removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting and analysis. Weighting The questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with Ipsos. The web program was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the Ipsos project management team and Pew Research Center researchers. The Ipsos project management team also populated test data which was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as intended before launching the survey. Incentives All respondents were offered a post-paid incentive for their participation. Respondents could choose to receive the post-paid incentive in the form of a check or a gift code to Amazon.com or could choose to decline the incentive.

For example, 58% of Americans ages 18 to 29 say it is more important for their country to have a close relationship to China than say the same about Germany (32%). But among older Americans, more say the relationship with Germany is more important than the relationship with China. There are also slight partisan differences in the U.S. on the choice of a close relationship with Russia or Germany. About two-thirds of Democrats (66%) say they prefer close ties with Germany, compared with 57% of Republicans.

And in Germany, supporters of CDU/CSU are more willing to want greater cooperation with the U.S. than those who support the Greens and the SPD. This jibes with data on the international image of the U.S., where those on the ideological right in Germany tend to be more favorable toward the U.S. overall. When asked to choose between having a close relationship to Germany or Russia, Americans clearly favor Germany (61% to 26%). When Germans are asked to choose between Russia and the U.S., however, the gap is smaller (39% to 25%), and three-in-ten Germans volunteer both. But as it relates to a rising China, attitudes diverge the other way. Germans are about twice as likely to say they prefer a close relationship to the U.S. over China (50% to 24%), while Americans are almost equally divided (41% prefer Germany, under NATO and relations with other world powers such as Russia and China.

Americans are also more likely than Germans to say it is sometimes necessary to use military force.

Where the entire transverse section of a fissureis exposed it is seen to be a deep V -shaped ravine or gullet, tapering to a point below , and the rocks below it are wholly undisturbed . Such a case is well shown very near the inn in the cliff. The varieties of breccia-gashes * enumerated above are illustratedby diagrammatic sketches in Plate XII .,Figs . 1,2, 3,and 4 ,whilst the nature of the breccia itselfis shown in Plate XIII ., which has been drawn from a photograph of one of the largest gashes near the north end of Marsden Bay , kindly taken for the writer by Mr. W. G. Laws , jun ., A.Sc. * The word gash is a convenientone used occasionallyby lead-miners to expressa 174 BRECCIA -GASHES . But the theory goes further than this, and explains equally well, the writer thinks , all the facts connected with the puzzling Breccia -gashes of the coast. The forms of these gashes , which are gullet-shaped and tapering downwards , unlike the sea-caves ; the breccia with which they are filled; the matter with which the fragments are cemented ; the half broken beds which so often bridge over the upper portions of the fissures; and the unbroken beds immediately above and below them , which would be inconceivable had the fissures and their in-fillingsbeen due to real earthquakes— all these things are necessary accompaniments of the rock -collapses which , it has been shown , must in time past have happened frequently, are happening still, and must happen more and more frequently in the future. Mr. C. L. CUMMINGS said, that all he knew upon the subject was contained in the paper . These shocks had not been felt so often since VOL.XXINI PLATE XII.

He would be glad to put in the figures when the paper was discussed. This was not a cavern , it was evidently a large fissure. He presumed Professor Lebour suggested that these Breccia -gashes originallyhad been in that form , and that the surrounding rocks had fallen in.

II. Since the beginning of lastDecember (1883 ) it iswell known to most members of the Institute that earth disturbances , which it is not easy to name more definitely, have repeatedly alarmed the inhabitants of certain localitiesin and near Sunderland . These disturbances have , it is true, been repeatedly called “ earthquakes ” and “ shocks ” in the local papers , and it must be admitted that some shaking of the surface and shocks to the dwellers in the affected areas did undoubtedly form part of the manifestations . But the evidences of deep -seated action, and of wide -spread effectsdue to it,which are characteristicof true earthquakes , have been remarkably absent in all published and unpublished records of the occurrences . Indeed , the disturbances have been singularly local strictlyaccurate, but no hint is given as to what “ the disturbing forces which produced ” the brecciated rock might be . Sir Charles Lyell, in a letterto Leonard Horner , dated September 1st, 1838 , thus refers to the coast at Marsden which he had just visited for the firsttime :- " The coast scenery was very grand , and the brecciated * There isalsosome lessdefiniteevidenceof shocks of much thesame character having taken placein or near Sunderland about elevenyears ago.

Distribution of image types in the MMMU dataset. C. Subfields of Different Subjects In this appendix, we show all the subfields of each subject in Table 11. MMMU has 183 subfields in total, covering 30 subjects. D. Distributions of Image Types In this section, we show the distribution of 30 different im- age types in the 11.5K MMMU questions. The distribution demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning. MMMU includes 11.5K meticulously collected multimodal questions from college exams, quizzes, and text- books, covering six core disciplines: Art & Design, Busi- ness, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. These questions span 30 subjects and 183 subfields, comprising 30 highly het- erogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. Unlike ex- isting benchmarks, MMMU focuses on advanced perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, challenging models to perform tasks akin to those faced by experts. The evaluation of 14 open-source LMMs as well as the propri- etary GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini highlights the substantial *Core Contributors.

Overview of MMMU We introduce the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Un- derstanding and Reasoning ( MMMU) benchmark, a novel benchmark meticulously curated to assess the expert-level multimodal understanding capability of foundation models across a broad scope of tasks. Covering 30 subjects across 6 disciplines, including Art, Business, Health & Medicine, Science, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engi- neering, and over 183 subfields. The detailed subject cover- age and statistics are detailed in Figure 3. The questions in our benchmark were manually collected by a team of 50 college students (including coauthors) from various dis- ciplines and subjects, drawing from online sources, text- books, and lecture materials. MMMU, constituting 11.5K questions, is divided into a few-shot development set, a validation set, and a test set. sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks span- ning six common disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Sci- ence, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering.MMMU consists of 11.5K carefully selected multimodal questions, which cover30 diverse sub- jects and 183 subfields, thus meeting the breadth goal. Moreover, many problems withinMMMU require expert-level reasoning, such as applying “Fourier Transform” or “Equi- librium Theory” to derive the solution, thus meeting the depth goal. MMMU also presents two unique challenges ab- sent in current benchmarks (Figure 1). Firstly, it covers di- verse image formats, from visual scenes like photographs and paintings to diagrams and tables, testing the perceptual capabilities of LMMs. Secondly, MMMU features interleaved text-image inputs. A model needs to jointly understand the images and text, which often requires recalling deep subject knowledge, and conducting complex reasoning based on the\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: How many samples in MMMU belong to sociology subject?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

Analysis on Images Types and Difficulties Different Image Types. We compare the performance of various models across top frequent image types in Fig- ure 5. Across all types, GPT-4V consistently outperforms the other models by a huge margin. Open-source models demonstrate relatively strong performance in categories like Photos and Paintings, which are more frequently seen dur- ing training. However, for less common image categories like Geometric shapes, Music sheets and Chemical struc- tures, all models obtain very low scores (some are close to random guesses). This indicates that the existing models are generalizing poorly towards these image types. Different Difficulty Levels.

We additionally combine two SLMs with ensemble or reranking approach (i.e., replace the LLM with another SLM as the reranker) to verify that improvements from our SLM-LLM integrated system are not solely due to the ensemble effects. 5.3 Main Results Table 3 shows that our filter-then-rerank method consistently improves performance across three datasets and nine settings. For instance, with In- structGPT, reranking provides an average F1 gain of 2.4% without SLM ensemble (Lines 4 vs. 7).

We show their statistics in Table 6. A.2 Details of Few-shot IE Datasets from 4 to 168. We show their statistics in Table 6. A.2 Details of Few-shot IE Datasets Sampling Algorithm for Train/Valid Datasets. We downsample sentences from original training dataset to construct few-shot training and valid datasets. We adopt K-shot sampling strategy that each label has (at least) K samples. We set 6 K- values (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100) for RE tasks and 4 K-values (1, 5, 10, 20) for other tasks. For RE task, each sentence has exactly one relation and we simply select K sentences for each label. For NER, ED and EAE tasks, each sentences is possible to contain more than one entities/events/arguments. Since our sampling is at sentence-level, the algo- rithm of accurate sampling , i.e., finding exactly K samples for each label, is NP-complete 8 and unlikely to find a practical solution. Therefore we follow Yang and Katiyar (2020) adopting a greedy sampling algorithm to select sentences for NER and ED tasks, as shown in Algorithm 1.

This uplift on a small subset significantly enhances the overall performance. GPT-4 is more aggressiveFrom Tables 3 and 4, GPT-4 generally improves more on hard samples, yet InstructGPT surpasses GPT-4 in NER and RE tasks when evaluated overall. This discrepancy arises from GPT-4’s aggressive reranking which introduces more true positives. InstructGPT, how- ever, focuses more on reducing false positives. Few makes small costFigure 7 demonstrates that our method impressively reduces budget and la- tency by approximately 80%~90% compared to direct ICL. This reduction is due to (1) fewer LLM callings (only for hard samples) and (2) shorter prompts (fewer candidate labels and demos). 5.5 Ablation Study We investigate the effectiveness of the modules in adaptive filter-then-rerank system by removing each of them in turn: (1) CoT: We exclude the explantion for each examples in demo.

Current ratings for the Trump administration’s ethical standards are lower than for those at various points in other administrations dating back to when the question was first asked by ABC News and The Washington Post of Ronald Reagan’s administration in 1983. This question has often been asked when previous administrations have faced specific ethical controversies.

The President of the Mess, NMRC Commanding Officer Capt. John Sand- ers, led the guest of honor, Rear Adm. Bruce A. Doll, head of Bureau of Medi- cine and Surgery research and develop- ment, and the other Dining Out partici- pants into the dining hall while the Navy Hymn played. When everyone was as- sembled, Sanders began the evening by saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, mess night for the Naval Medical Research Center is now open. Welcome and thank you for joining us this evening, please re- main standing for the playing of our Na- tional Anthem.” The rest of the evening followed strict Naval protocol, an established tradition that reaches back to the Vikings and the (vomiting and diarrhea) affecting 64 crew members over a three-week pe- riod while underway.

Since 2010, Navy biomedical researchers have been collaborating with the Liberian Institute of Biomedical Re- search (LIBR) on two research projects funded by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center/Global Emerging Infections System (AFHSC-GEIS). These projects focus on disease vector surveillance, detection of vector-borne viral pathogens such as malaria, and vector control. The projects are enabling the country to independently expand vector- borne disease surveillance and detection capabilities in Li- beria to benefit the Liberian Armed Forces as well as the entire population of Liberia.

With the assistance of OOL, NAMRU-3 has pursued mili- tary-to-military engagements with the Armed Forces of Libe- ria (AFL) through vector control training efforts in collabora- tion with LIBR. On a tour of Camp Edward Binyah, Oyofo met with Pfc. Nadoris Nador and Pfc. Henry Morris, two AFL Preventive Medicine Technicians. They told Oyofo how they had bene- fited from the training offered through NAMRU-3 AFHSC- GEIS projects. Nador expressed her appreciation for the training in vec- tor surveillance, vector biology/identification and vector con- trol, saying, “The knowledge and the equipment provided by NAMRU-3 has very much improved our ability to protect our soldiers and their families from disease.” From left: Lt.

In a separate meeting, the Director of LIBR said, “The collaboration with NAMRU-3 is helping to restore many of the capabilities that LIBR had before the war.” During a meeting with Graham, he expressed particular interest in the project combining insecticide spraying for all base housing with surveillance and geospacial mapping to determine the distribution of malaria-transmitting mosqui- toes. No malaria infections have been diagnosed in U.S troops since the onset of the spraying, which is carried out by NAMRU-3 in collaboration with the Navy Entomology Center of Excellence (NECE).

Within families, each sibling has a 25 percent chance of being HLA identical to a second sibling. But 70 percent of patients needing trans- plants do not have a match in their family and rely on finding a match from among 10,000,000 volunteers listed on the National Marrow Donor Program registry. Because of the incredible diversity of HLA types in America, many more donors are needed. There are thousands of HLA types from each of the four HLA genes that are matched for transplan- tation and millions of potential combinations of the eight types for each person, one set of four HLA genes from each parent. If the donor who matches a patient is registered in the C. W. Bill Young DoD Program, a program representa- tive contacts the potential donor and works closely with both the donor and the command.

In 1863 an overland stage line followed this route and “Prairie Camp” was established as a relay station six miles west of the Millspaw Ranch. Another trail ran adjacent to the Platte River in northern Hamilton County and the earliest known ranch providing service to this trail was established in 1862 by J. T.

We focus only on lots that already were, or would be (by 2007), zoned to permit residential use. To provide a sense of the scale of the rezoning activity: of the 816,000 lots that existed in 2003, approximately 188,000 were subject to a City-initiated rezoning action by the end of 2007.3 Figure A reveals how these rezonings were distrib uted throughout the City. To measure residential development capac - ity, we use the lot’s Floor Area Ratio (FAR), which limits a building’s size to a multiple of the area of the lot. For example, a build - ing on a 10,000 square foot lot that is in a zoning district with a FAR of 2.0 would be 3 We exclude streets, parks, airports and other large public facilities. How Have recent rezonings Affected the city’s Ability to Grow? 5 Our analysis classifies as “contextual-only” any zoning change to a lot that does not increase or decrease its residential devel - opment capacity by more than 10%. Most of the lots rezoned between 2003 and 2007 fall into this category (particularly in Staten Island and Queens). Our estimates of residential development capacity are based on the maximum FAR that the Zoning Resolution assigns to dif - ferent lots. But the Zoning Resolution regulates development in a number of other ways as well, through height limits, front, side and rear yard requirements, lot coverage limits and minimum off-street parking requirements, for example. FAR limits the total size of a new building, but these other regulations help determine its shape and placement on its site. If a zon - ing change doesn’t alter a lot’s maximum FAR, it is likely changing some of these other types of regulations.

There are a lot of thought-provoking findings here, but in many ways, these find- ings raise more questions than they answer. With the foundation we’ve now built, the Furman Center is studying several ques - tions we think are important to explore. the impact of rezonings Earlier we discussed the potential benefits and burdens that upzonings and downzon - ings present for communities, but there is little empirical work examining how rezon - ings actually affect a neighborhood. With the data we’ve compiled about the zoning changes, coupled with the rich data the Fur- man Center has on New York City’s housing and neighborhoods, we now have a unique opportunity to track impacts over time. We practical impact on development capacity that we currently are unable to measure because we focus only on maximum FAR. The combined impacts of height limits and required yard dimensions, for exam - ple, could make it practically impossible to develop some lots to their full FAR. We will continue to analyze the contextual zoning districts to better understand the role these non-FAR regulations may play in determining how intensely lots in New York City are developed.

Downzoned lots were in areas that saw significantly less building activity, while contextual-only rezoned lots were in areas that had much higher rates of development than the City median. These findings have several important implica - tions. The fact the upzonings took place in areas with average levels of development may signal that the upzonings will have to lead, rather than follow, the market. It may be appropriate for upzonings to try to chan- nel growth into areas where the market has not yet signaled interest if, for example, the City believes infrastructure in those areas is underused, or if the City plans to upgrade infrastructure it believes was holding devel- opment back.

First, as Figure D shows, upzoned lots tended to be located in census tracts with a higher proportion of non-white residents than the median tract in the City. Downzo - ned lots, on the other hand, were more likely to be located in tracts with a higher share of non-Hispanic white residents than the City median, and contextual-only rezoned lots were located in areas with still higher shares of non-Hispanic white residents. 5 We use median values rather than mean values because of the great variation among New York City neighborhoods.

To estimate median values of socioeconomic characteristics (including racial/ethnic per - centages, median income and homeowner - ship rate) for areas where different types of rezoned lots were located (as reported in Figure D and Tables B, C and D) , we use 2000 census tract boundaries and data. For our “baseline” median New York City tract, we report the median value of each char - acteristic for all census tracts in New York City. For the tracts in which upzoned, down- zoned or contextual-only rezoned lots were located, we use the median for all tracts in which at least one of that type of rezoned lot was located, weighted by the number of lots of that type in the tract.

In future work, we will explore the relationship of rezonings to other critical infrastructure assets such as parks, school capacity and quality, and sewer capacity. We also plan to build on this analysis of transit access by looking not just at proximity, but also at the capacity of lines serving these neighbor- hoods, and to expand the analysis to include express buses. the interplay between rezonings and parking requirements Some of the contextual-only rezonings add requirements for parking that effectively reduce the potential for new development.

To better understand whether the City’s rezonings created new capacity in areas primed for growth, we look at three measures of demand prior to the rezonings: population growth, the number of new certificates of occupancy issued, and the rate of house price appreciation.

There are a lot of thought-provoking findings here, but in many ways, these find- ings raise more questions than they answer. With the foundation we’ve now built, the Furman Center is studying several ques - tions we think are important to explore. the impact of rezonings Earlier we discussed the potential benefits and burdens that upzonings and downzon - ings present for communities, but there is little empirical work examining how rezon - ings actually affect a neighborhood. With the data we’ve compiled about the zoning changes, coupled with the rich data the Fur- man Center has on New York City’s housing and neighborhoods, we now have a unique opportunity to track impacts over time. We City’s stated development, environmental and transportation goals. The Furman Cen- ter has filled this gap by conducting the first statistical analysis of the cumulative impact of New York City’s recent rezonings. We set out to answer several key questions: n How have the rezonings changed the City’s capacity for new residential development? n Where has new residential capac- ity been added? Where has existing capacity been lost? n What are the characteristics of communities that gained capacity? Of those that lost capacity? n How does the location of new/lost capacity relate to the City’s public transportation infrastructure? n Does the location of new/lost capacity correspond to market demand and population growth? n How likely is it that new capacity will be developed for residential use? This policy brief summarizes our findings for each of these questions, and identifies areas where researchers and policymakers ought to explore these issues in greater detail. tH e fur MA n center for reAl estAte AnD urBA n Policy is a joint research center of the New York University School of Law and the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Since its founding in 1995, the Furman Center has become a leading academic research center dedicated to providing objective academic and empirical research on the legal and public policy issues involving land use, real estate, housing and urban affairs in the United States, with a particular focus on New York City. More information about the Furman Center can be found at www.furmancenter.org. 17 Notes on Methodology We estimate changes in residential develop - ment capacity at the lot level. Accordingly, all estimates of capacity changes for the City, community districts, boroughs and other geographic areas, including area within and beyond a half mile walking distance from rail transit, are aggregations of lot-level data. To estimate median values of socioeconomic ing a mean value for some of these variables skews the values upwards or downwards depending on the variable. For infor- mation about how we calculate socioeconomic and demograph- ic characteristics of tracts where rezoned lots were located, see the methodological notes at the end of this document. figure c: change in residential capacity n +10% and Greater n +5% – +9.9% n +0.5% – +4.9% n No Net Change n -0.5% – -4.9% n -5% – -9.9% n -10% and Greater n Parks/Airports n Community Districts How Have recent rezonings Affected the city’s Ability to Grow? 6 We conduct this research on a lot-by-lot basis, because most rezonings include dif - ferent types of changes—upzoning or downzoning some lots while contextual- only rezoning others. In order to under - stand the net impact on the City, therefore, we needed to aggregate the changes made to individual lots. The City’s Zoning Resolution is massive and complicated. While our calculations repre - sent the first attempt to systematically map cumulative changes in residential capacity, our methodology has some limitations. We simply could not adjust for every development and regulatory characteristic that may affect what can be built on a lot. In some cases, our capacity calculations may overstate capacity because we can’t adjust for park - ing requirements and other development requirements that would reduce the actual buildable area. On the other hand, we are also unable to adjust for regulations that\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: How many research questions does this paper answer?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

However, existing fact-checking sys- tems often lack transparency in their decision- making, making it challenging for users to com- prehend their reasoning process. To address this, we propose the Question-guided Multi- hop Fact-Checking(QACHECK ) system, which guides the model’s reasoning process by ask- ing a series of questions critical for verifying a claim. QACHECK has five key modules: a claim verifier, a question generator, a question- answering module, a QA validator, and a rea- soner. Users can input a claim into QACHECK , ifying open-domain claims with QACHECK , as shown in Figure 4. The QACHECK demo is de- signed to be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling users to input any claim or select from a list of pre-defined claims (top half of Figure 4). 6https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/ Upon selecting or inputting a claim, the user can start the fact-checking process by clicking the “Submit” button.

In contrast, our approach employs question–answer pair based explanations, offering more human-like and natural explanations. 3 System Architecture Figure 2 shows the general architecture of our sys- tem, comprised of five principal modules: a Claim Limitations We identify two main limitations of QACHECK . First, several modules of our QACHECK currently utilize external API-based large language models, such as InstructGPT. This reliance on external APIs tends to prolong the response time of our system. As a remedy, we are considering the integration of open-source, locally-run large language models like LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023). Secondly, the current scope of our QACHECK is confined to eval- uating True/Falseclaims. Recognizing the signifi- cance of also addressing Not Enough Information claims, we plan to devise strategies to incorporate these in upcoming versions of the system. Ethics Statement The use of large language models requires a signifi- cant amount of energy for computation for training, which contributes to global warming. Our work performs few-shot in-context learning instead of training models from scratch, so the energy foot- print of our work is less.

For the ev- idence corpus, we use the Wikipedia dump pro- vided by the Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks (KILT) benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021), in which the Wikipedia articles have been pre-processed and separated into paragraphs. For the retriever, we apply the widely-used sparse retrieval based on BM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009), imple- mented with the Pyserini toolkit (Lin et al., 2021).

HOVER con- tains 1,126 two-hop claims, 1,835 three-hop claims, and 1,039 four-hop claims, while FEVEROUS has 2,962 multi-hop claims. We compare our method with the baselines of directly applying InstructGPT with two different prompting methods: ( i) direct prompting with the claim, and (ii) CoT (Wei et al., 2022) or chain-of-thought prompting with few- shot demonstrations of reasoning explanations. We also compare with ProgramFC (Pan et al., 2023), FLAN-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), and Codex (Chen et al., 2021). We use the reported results for the baseline models from Pan et al.

QACHECK offers enough adaptability, allowing users to customize the design of each module by integrating with different models. For example, we provide three alternative implementations for the QA component: the retriever–reader model, the FLAN-T5 model, and the GPT3-based reciter– reader model. Furthermore, we offer a user-friendly interface for users to fact-check any input claim and visualize its detailed question-guided reason- ing process.

For each reasoning step, the system shows the index of the reasoning step, the generated question, and the predicted answer to the question. The retrieved evidence to support the answer is shown on the right for each step. The system then shows the final veracity prediction for the original claim accom- panied by a comprehensive rationale in the “Pre- fact-checker needs to decompose the claim, gather multiple pieces of evidence, and perform step-by- step reasoning (Pan et al., 2023). This reasoning process can be formulated as question-guided rea- soning, where the verification of the claim is guided by asking and answering a series of relevant ques- tions, as shown in Figure 1. In this example, we se- quentially raise two questions: “What is the great- est depth of the Black Sea?” and “How far can sunlight penetrate water?”. After independently answering these two questions by gathering rele- vant information from the Web, we can assert that the initial claim is false with simple reasoning. While several models (Liu et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2020; Aly and Vlachos, 2022) have been proposed to facilitate multi-step reasoning in fact- checking, they generally lack transparency in their reasoning processes. These models simply take a claim as input, then output a veracity label without claim as input, then output a veracity label without an explicit explanation. Recent attempts, such as Quin+ (Samarinas et al., 2021) and WhatTheWiki- Fact (Chernyavskiy et al., 2021), have aimed to de- velop more explainable fact-checking systems, by arXiv:2310.07609v1 [cs.CL] 11 Oct 2023 QA Model:GPT Reciter–Reader 1.

Finally, it presents the final prediction label with the supporting rationale. 3.5 Reasoner The reasoner is called when the claim verifier deter- mines that the context C is sufficient to verify the claim or the system hits the maximum allowed iter- ations, set to 5 by default. The reasoner is a special question-answering model which takes the context C and the claim c as inputs and then answers the searching and visualizing the supporting evidence for a given claim. However, these systems primar- ily validate a claim from a single document, and do not provide a detailed, step-by-step visualization of the reasoning process as shown in Figure 1. We introduce the Question-guided Multi-hop Fact-Checking (QACHECK ) system, which ad- dresses the aforementioned issues by generating multi-step explanations via question-guided rea- soning. To facilitate an explainable reasoning pro- cess, QACHECK manages the reasoning process by guiding the model to self-generate a series of ques- tions vital for claim verification. Our system, as depicted in Figure 2, is composed of five modules: 1) a claim verifier that assesses whether sufficient information has been gathered to verify the claim, 2) a question generator to generate the next rele- vant question, 3) a question-answering module to answer the raised question, 4) a QA validator to evaluate the usefulness of the generated (Q, A) pair,\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: In the figure that locates at the top of page 5, what is the final step?

QACHECK conducts the reasoning process with the guidance of asking and answer- ing a series of questions and answers. Specifically, QACHECK iteratively generates contextually rel- evant questions, retrieves and validates answers, evaluate the usefulness of the generated (Q, A) pair, and 5) a reasoner to output the final veracity label based on all collected contexts. QACHECK offers enough adaptability, allowing users to customize the design of each module by integrating with different models. For example, we provide three alternative implementations for the QA component: the retriever–reader model, the FLAN-T5 model, and the GPT3-based reciter– reader model. Furthermore, we offer a user-friendly interface for users to fact-check any input claim and visualize its detailed question-guided reason- ing process. The screenshot of our user interface is shown in Figure 4. We will discuss the implementa- tion details of the system modules in Section 3 and some evaluation results in Section 4. Finally, we present the details of the user interface in Section 5. and conclude and discuss future work in Section 6. 2 Related Work Fact-Checking Systems.

The system’s reliability largely depends on the accuracy of the QA module’s responses. Understanding the need for different QA methods in various fact-checking print of our work is less. The large language model (InstructGPT) whose API we use for inference con- sumes significant energy.

We take ad- vantage of InstructGPT’s in-context learning abil- ity to implement the claim verifier. We prompt InstructGPT with ten distinct in-context examples as detailed in Appendix A.1, where each example consists of a claim and relevant question–answer pairs.

These scores are better than directly using InstructGPT, Codex, or FLAN-T5. They are also on par with the systems that apply claim decomposition strategies, i.e., CoT, and ProgramFC. The results demonstrate the effec- tiveness of our QACHECK system. Especially, the QACHECK has better improvement over the end- to-end models on claims with high reasoning depth. This indicates that decomposing a complex claim into simpler steps with question-guided reasoning can facilitate more accurate reasoning. 5 User Interface We create a demo system based on Flask6 for ver- ifying open-domain claims with QACHECK , as shown in Figure 4. The QACHECK demo is de- question-answering model which takes the context C and the claim c as inputs and then answers the question “Is the claim true or false?”. The model is also requested to output the rationale with the prediction. We provide two different implementa- tions for the reasoner: 1) the end-to-end QA model based on FLAN-T5, and 2) the InstructGPT model with the prompts given in Appendix A.4. 4 Performance Evaluation To evaluate the performance of our QACHECK , we use two fact-checking datasets that contain complex claims requiring multi-step reasoning: HOVER (Jiang et al., 2020) and FEVEROUS (Aly et al., 2021), following the same experimental set- Yichen Jiang, Shikha Bordia, Zheng Zhong, Charles Dognin, Maneesh Singh, and Mohit Bansal. 2020.

However, existing fact-checking sys- tems often lack transparency in their decision- making, making it challenging for users to com- prehend their reasoning process. To address this, we propose the Question-guided Multi- hop Fact-Checking(QACHECK ) system, which guides the model’s reasoning process by ask- ing a series of questions critical for verifying a claim. QACHECK has five key modules: a claim verifier, a question generator, a question- answering module, a QA validator, and a rea- soner. Users can input a claim into QACHECK ,\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: What is the average performance gap between the ProgramFC performance and our proposed system in the HOVER dataset?

To be specific, we select users that 1) wrote product reviews for at least 10 different items they purchased, and where 2) each product review contains between 30 to 80 words. Table 3 shows the statistics after the fil- tration. For example, using these criteria, 1,791 active users are selected for the Amazon-music dataset. Each user in the Amazon- music dataset has an average of 990.48 review words over all of his/her reviews, averaging 51.01 words for each review. 3.3 Dataset Statistics Aside from our constructed Amazon-beauty and Amazon-music dataset, we also include an existing dataset Personality 2018 in our study. Personality 2018 7 [14] is a version of the MovieLens dataset that includes each user’s personality information obtained through questionnaires. It contains 21,776 movies, 339,000 ratings, and 678 users with the OCEAN personality questionnaire scores from 1 to 7. This dataset is included to study the difference between 35 factors, including OCEAN scores. For each user that wrote reviews in either of the two domains, we collect all his/her review texts and concatenate them together into a single document. Afterward, we send the concatenated text to Receptiviti to infer a personality. We select the personality scores corresponding to the five-dimensional personality traits defined in the OCEAN model [12] (Table 2). Each personality score is normal- ized to a range from 1 to 100. The higher the score, the more overt the personality trait. Note that each of the five OCEAN scores is independent of the other.

Afterward, we concatenate all the valid review texts of each user and input their concatenation to the Receptiviti API to output each user’s inferred personality scores. As a quality check, we evaluate the accuracy of personality detection, by plotting the personality distribution for each dataset. We observe the users with extremely high/low personality scores and find that these are reli- able indicators of personality, and use the such confidently labeled output as ground truth (silver data). We incorporate these personality scores into the recommenda- tion process and investigate their effect on current neural-based recommendation systems. We observe consistent improvements on the performance of such recommendation systems. When we consider different personality groups, we find that extroversion and agreeableness benefit the recommendation performances across all production-level APIs for automatic personality detection, such as IBM Personality Insights2, Humantic AI3, and Receptiviti4 that purport to yield personality profiles. In our work here, we use the Receptiviti API, because it is a widely-validated and widely-used psychology-based language analysis platform for understanding human emotion, personality, motivation, and psychology from lan- guage. Receptiviti’s API outputs scores for the commonly-used OCEAN personality model: five values, one for each of the five personality aspects of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (each corresponding to one letter of “OCEAN”). Finally, this inferred personality is fed as input to a recommendation system, to test whether it can improve recom- mendation performance.

However, the im- provement in the Personality 2018 is less obvious than that in the Amazon-beauty dataset. We hypothesize the reason might be due to the difference in the sizes of the datasets. Since Amazon-beauty that receive the top 10 highest scores on this type. We analyze both the Amazon-beauty and the Amazon-music datasets, resulting in a total of 100 samples. These samples are evaluated by two gradu- ate students. Both were trained with a detailed explanation of the OCEAN personality model. We ask them to choose whether the sampled review texts accurately match their inferred personality, choosing between three options of yes, no, or not sure . We then calculate the accuracy of the samples and the inter-annotator agree- ment between the two annotators using Cohen’s Kappa [ 5]. We find that the inferred personality matches with the review text in 81% of the Amazon-beauty samples, and 79% of the samples from Amazon-music. The average Cohen’s Kappa is 0.70.

For example, in the Sci-Fact (Wadden strates the complexity of reasoning in SCITAB. Reasoning Graph. We showcase the reasoning graph for the example in Figure 1 on the right side of the figure. Verifying this claim requires vari- ous types of reasoning including: 1) background knowledge from the table caption: “productivity” corresponds to the “Prod.” column in the table; 2) commonsense knowledge: “random chance” means 50% accuracy; 3) simple lookup: “A’s productiv- ity” refers to the cell located at the last row and signed for SCITAB. Closed-domain knowledge refers to obtaining background information from the table caption or title, e.g., knowing that “Prod.” refers to “Productivity” from the table caption in Figure 1. Open-domain knowledge refers to com- monsense knowledge not presented in the table, e.g., the relationship between precision and recall. Given the designed reasoning types, we manually analyze 100 samples in SCITAB, by annotating the graph of reasoning steps for verifying each claim. We identify 476 atomic reasoning steps from the 100 analyzed samples and show the proportion for each reasoning type in Table 2. We observe thatSC- ITAB has a multifaceted complex range of reason- ing types and a high proportion of claims requiring different types of domain knowledge. Reasoning Depth. We further measure the rea- soning depth (the number of required reasoning steps) for each claim and show the reasoning depth distribution in Figure 3. We find that the analyzed Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) (Chen et al., 2022) model that has shown strong ability in solving com- plex numerical reasoning tasks. It first parses the reasoning steps as Python programs and then exe- cutes them on a Python interpreter to derive accu- rate answers.

However, most of these datasets rely on text evidence to verify claims. SEM-TAB-FACTS (Wang et al., 2021) is the only existing dataset based on scientific tables, but it is limited to simple, crowd-sourced claims. To bridge this gap, we construct SCITAB which contains complex claims from authentic scientific papers with table-based evidence. Table-based Reasoning. Table-based reasoning requires reasoning over both free-form natural lan- guage queries and (semi-)structured tables. Early claims in the existing benchmarks are solely vali- dated against text-based evidence, primarily paper abstracts.

This disparity highlights a significant gap be- tween the existing benchmarks and real-world sci- entific fact-checking needs. To bridge these gaps, a dataset that 1) compiles real-world claims from scientific papers, and 2) includes original scientific data such as tables and figures, is needed. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset SC- ITAB, which fulfills these stated criteria. It contains 1,225 challenging scientific claims, each demand- ing compositional reasoning for verification using scientific tables.

Our inter-annotator agreement is 0.630 for the false claim verification task (872 claims in total) and 0.719 for the NEI claim verification task (900 claims in total). Both values indicate substantial agreement among the annotators. 3 Data Analysis Table 1 shows the statistics of our SCITAB dataset and the comparison with three existing table fact- checking datasets: TabFact (Chen et al., 2020), FEVEROUS (Aly et al., 2021), and SEM-TAB- FACTS (Wang et al., 2021). Compared with these plications drawn from the results), e.g., “This in- dicates that ...” (2) Comparison of results with those from prior studies, e.g., “Different from ...” (3) Explanation or speculation (possible reasons or cause-effect relationships for the results), e.g., “The possible reason is that ...” A.2 Claim Extraction Interface Figure 5 shows the user interface for the claim extraction task. B Manual Claim Verification Procedure B.1 Annotator Training Process Our annotator selection and training process is sys- tematic and thorough to ensure the highest quality annotations. We initiate the process by advertising on our university’s platform. Interested candidates are then required to complete a registration form. From these responses, the authors identify suitable annotators based on set criteria. Once shortlisted, the potential annotators are invited for a training session, which can be conducted either in-person or via Zoom, lasting approximately one hour. This quire numerical reasoning, we want to test whether program-guided reasoning can be extended to table- based fact-checking. Human Performance. To examine how humans perform on our SCITAB dataset, we hired an anno- tator from our candidate annotators pool, following the same training procedure as other annotators. In the case of 2-class classification, we randomly selected 40 samples: 20 each for supported and refuted claims. For 3-class classification, we ran- domly selected 60 random samples, ensuring an even distribution of 20 samples across the three la- bel categories (supported, refuted, and not enough information). The annotator took approximately 1.5 hours for the 2-class fact-checking task and 2 hours for the 3-class setting. We report the Macro- F1 scores at the bottom of Table 4. for a week is ok. • Could you provide some advice on how to improve the annotation platform?

This case study provides further insights into the complexity and variety of reasoning involved in SCITAB, revealing the difficulty of the dataset. 3.2 Refuted and NEI Claims Analysis One potential risk of model-generated claims is that they may lack diversity and exhibit the same pattern. For example, in the Sci-Fact (Wadden distribution in Figure 3. We find that the analyzed claims have an average depth of 4.76 and a max- imum depth of 11. Moreover, 86% of the claims requiring 3 or more reasoning steps, which demon- strates the complexity of reasoning in SCITAB. Reasoning Graph. We showcase the reasoning graph for the example in Figure 1 on the right side of the figure. Verifying this claim requires vari- FEVEROUS (Aly et al., 2021), and SEM-TAB- FACTS (Wang et al., 2021). Compared with these datasets, SCITAB is 1) annotated by domain ex- perts rather than crowd-sourced workers, 2) con- tains more challenging claims that require up to 11 reasoning steps for verification, and 3) has a more balanced distribution of veracity labels and a higher percentage of NEI claims. We conduct a more in-depth analysis of SCITAB as follows. 3.1 Reasoning Analysis Reasoning Types. To study the nature of reason- ing involved in fact-checking claims in SCITAB, 2The payment is fair and aligned with the guideline for dataset creation (Bender and Friedman, 2018). we adapt the set of table-based reasoning cate- gories from INFOTABS (Gupta et al., 2020) to define 14 atomic reasoning types, as shown in Ta- ble 2. Among them, “closed-domain knowledge” and “open-domain knowledge” are specially de- signed for SCITAB. Closed-domain knowledge refers to obtaining background information from scores the challenging nature of SCITAB. Addi- tionally, established prompting methods like Chain- of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) and Program-of- Thought (Chen et al., 2022) which typically en- hance performance across most reasoning tasks, do not bring performance gain on SCITAB. Our error analysis sheds light on several unique chal- lenges in SCITAB that may lead to this, such as table grounding, dealing with ambiguous claims, and compositional reasoning. We make our dataset fully accessible to the research community. 2 The S CITAB Dataset We adopt a human–model collaboration strategy to construct SCITAB, as shown in Figure 2. We describe the steps involved in data preparation (Sec- tion 2.1), automatic claim generation (Section 2.2), and manual claim verification (Section 2.3). 2.1 Data Preparation We use the publicly available SciGen (Moosavi et al., 2021) dataset as our primary data source.

The storage capacity automatically scales as the volume of stored data grows. Dynamic data on devices such as mobile phones, PCs, and tablets interacts with the enterprise cloud disk service system built on Huawei Cloud. Requests for dynamic data are sent to the service system for processing and then returned to devices, and the static data is stored in OBS. Service systems can process static data over the intranet. End users can directly request and read the static data from OBS. In addition, OBS provides the lifecycle management function to automatically change storage classes for objects, reducing storage costs.

According to the findings presented in Table 7, the performance disparities among base- line models on existing datasets are not particularly marked. In contrast, on the SnapNTell dataset, we observed significantly larger differences and notably lower performance. This indicates that our SnapNTell dataset is particularly effective in evaluating the capabilities of different models to recognize entities and produce responses centered around these entities.

The Snap- NTell benchmark has been designed to evaluate models’ abilities in accurately identifying entities and generating responses that showcase a deep un- derstanding of these entities. To support this task, we have curated a new evaluation dataset that de- parts from existing datasets in two crucial ways: (1) SnapNTell: Enhancing Entity-Centric Visual Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Multimodal LLM Jielin Qiu1,2∗, Andrea Madotto1, Zhaojiang Lin1, Paul A.

Despite these advancements, VLLMs still encounter substantial difficulties in handling queries involving long-tail entities, with a ten- dency to produce erroneous or hallucinated responses. In this work, we introduce a novel evaluative benchmark namedSnapNTell, specifically tailored for entity-centric VQA. This task aims to test the models’ capabilities in identifying entities and providing detailed, entity-specific knowledge. We have developed and explainable. • SnapNTell dataset.We collected a new eval- uation dataset with distinctive characteristics, which stands out for two key features: (1) It encompasses a diverse range of fine-grained entities, each accompanied by correspond- ing representative images. (2) The question- answer pairs contain knowledge-intensive re- sponses with entity names specifically men- tioned in the answer sets. • Our model demonstrates superior perfor- mance on the SnapNTell dataset, surpassing current methodologies with a 66.5% improve- ment in BELURT score. 2 Related Works Knowledge-based VQA Research in vision- language tasks, which necessitate understanding image content to answer questions, has seen sig- nificant advancements over recent years.

Additionally, our dataset boasts a higher count of images and a longer average length for answers. Specifically, our dataset is structured to include 10 images for each entity, whereas the exact number of images per en- ties, encompassing 22 primary categories, was com- piled, in a total of 14,910 diverse entities. Then the entity list underwent filtering by cross-referencing each entry with its corresponding Wikipedia page. Entities lacking valid Wikipedia pages were sub- sequently removed from the list. For each corre- sponding entity, images were sourced from Cre- ative Commons (CC). Further filtering was con- ducted by removing entities that didn’t have a suffi- cient number of images obtained via Google Image Search engine. The collected metadata was stored in a CSV file containing essential information such as image URLs, source page URLs, renamed im- age names, and the corresponding Wikipedia page URLs. After filtering, the final number of entities in the SnapNTell dataset is 7,568. (More filtering details can be found in Appendix B.) 3.3 Knowledge-intensive Question-Answer Pairs In our SnapNTell dataset, we considered five types of questions: • Static facts (absolute facts, discrete facts). Limitations In this study, we introduce a novel SnapNTell task and its accompanying dataset, which features five unique types of questions, each paired with metic- ulously formulated answers. It’s important to rec- ognize that in cases involving human preferences, which are subjective by nature, the given answers might not represent the only correct options. Fur- thermore, the relevancy of some answers may di- minish over time, highlighting the need for peri- odic updates to the dataset to ensure its ongoing relevance and accuracy. Our proposed method ex- hibited superior performance over existing base- lines. However, human evaluation results suggest significant potential for further improvement. Al- though our approach often neared human-level per- formance, it did not consistently outperform human annotations, showing opportunities for future ad- vancements.

For image encoding, the CLIP image encoder (ViT-B/32) is employed (Radford et al., 2021; Schuhmann et al., 2022). Ad- ditional configurations comprise a batch size of 2,048, the integration of two resampler layers, and the use of 64 modality tokens. Model Training We used a cleaned subset of the LAION-2B dataset, filtered using the CAT method Performance of Different VQA Datasets To demonstrate the uniqueness of our SnapNTell dataset compared to existing VQA datasets, we an- alyzed the performance of various baseline models on both traditional VQA datasets and our SnapN- Tell dataset. According to the findings presented in Table 7, the performance disparities among base- line models on existing datasets are not particularly marked. In contrast, on the SnapNTell dataset, we observed significantly larger differences and notably lower performance. This indicates that our SnapNTell dataset is particularly effective in evaluating the capabilities of different models to recognize entities and produce responses centered around these entities.

We explain below our experimental setup, result and analysis of applying STEP -BACK PROMPTING on the MMLU high-school Physics and Chemistry benchmarks. 4.1 S TEP -BACK PROMPTING Questions in the MMLU benchmarks require deeper reasoning. Furthermore, they also require understanding and application of formulae which are often physics and chemistry principles and concepts. In this case, we first teach the model to do abstraction in the form of concepts and first principles such as Newton’s first law of motion, Doppler effect, and Gibbs free energyetc. The implicit step-back question here is “what are the physics or chemistry principles and concepts involved in 4\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: What score did LLaVa + Step-Back achieve in MMLU Physics?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

Applying either CoT or TDB zero-shot (and one-shot) prompting to the baseline model shows no improvement. In contrast, augmenting the baseline model by regular retrieval augmentation (RAG) improves the accuracy to 57.4%, highlighting the factual intensive nature of the task. The result of Step-Back + RAG shows the effectiveness of going back to a high-level concept, which enables much more reliable retrieval augmentation: the accuracy on TimeQA achieves a remarkable 68.7%. Next, we segment TimeQA into the Easy and Hard difficulty level provided in the original dataset. As expected, all methods perform worse on the Hard segment. While RAG can improve the Easy accuracy from 42.6% to 67.8%, the improvement is much smaller on the Hard accuracy: 40.4% to 46.8%.

Knowledge QA has been challenging for LLMs. In this section, we first describe the experimental setup, followed by results and analysis on STEP -BACK PROMPTING . 6 context to arrive at the right answer. StepBack rarely fails. In contrast, we find more than half of the errors are due to reasoning errors. 45% of errors are due to failure in retrieving the right information despite that Abstraction provided by step-back makes it a much easier task. This reflects the difficulty level of the TimeQA task. Additional error analysis of TimeQA is in Appendix A. 6 M ULTI -HOP REASONING We evaluate STEP -BACK PROMPTING on challenging Multi-Hop reasoning benchmark MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022) and StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021). We follow the same protocol as Section 5 to implement STEP -BACK PROMPTING . 6.1 R ESULTS Table 3 shows performance of various baselines on the dev set of MuSiQue and StrategyQA. Baseline performance of PaLM-2L and GPT4 are low (35.5% and 38.5% for PaLM-2L and GPT-4 respectively) in MuSiQue since it is a hard multihop reasoning behchmark. In contrast, StartegyQA has stronger For few-shot CoT prompting, we use the same template as the Baseline prompting in Sec.

Left: Step-Back + RAG vs Baseline predictions. Right: Step-Back RAG vs RAG predictions. Step-Back + RAG is able to fix 39.9% of the predictions where the baseline prediction is wrong, while causing 5.6% errors. Furthermore, Step-Back + RAG fixes 21.6% errors coming from RAG.

Or, looked at another way, among the 42.7 million U.S. adults who say they have Hispanic ancestry, 11% do not identify as Hispanic. This group also has distant immigrant roots. Some 38% are fourth or higher generation, i.e., the U.S.-born children of U.S.-born parents, U.S.-born grandparents and likely other U.S. born ancestors. Another 23% are third generation (the U.S.-born children of U.S.- born parents), 17% are second generation (the U.S.-born children of at least one immigrant parent), and just 12% are immigrants, according to the Pew Research Center survey of self-identified non-Hispanics with Hispanic ancestry. For adults with Hispanic ancestry who do not self-identify as Hispanic, 81% say they have never considered themselves Hispanic or Latino. The reasons for this are many and are often linked to Eight-in-ten non-Hispanics with Hispanic as Hispanic. Nearly all immigrant adults from Latin America or Spain (97%) say they are Hispanic. Similarly, second-generation adults with Hispanic ancestry (the U.S.-born children of at least one immigrant parent) have nearly as high a Hispanic self-identification rate (92%), according to Pew Research Center estimates. By the third generation – a group made up of the U.S.-born children of U.S.-born parents and immigrant grandparents – the share that self-identifies as Hispanic falls to 77%. And by the fourth Among Americans with Hispanic ancestry, share that identifies as Hispanic or Latino falls across immigrant generations % of U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry who self-identify as ___ Note: Self-identified Hispanics are those who say they are Hispanic. Self-identified non- Hispanics are those who say they are not Hispanic or Latino but say they have Hispanic ancestry or heritage. 24 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org \uf0a7 How about your grandparents, as far as you know, are any of them of Hispanic or Latino origin or descent, or not? \uf0a7 Thinking about your family history, as far as you know were any of your GREAT GRANDPARENTS or EARLIER ANCESTORS from Latin American or Spanish ancestry, or not? Combining the two surveys Some analyses in this report relied on combining data from both surveys. This was done by merging the two data files and adjusting the weights to that the two groups were proportional to their share of the total population. According to the 2015 American Community Survey, self- identified Hispanics make up 16% of the nation’s non-institutionalized adult population, or account for 37.8 million adults. The share that do not identify as Hispanic, but say they have a Hispanic parent or grandparent was estimated to be just under 2% of all U.S. adults8, or 4.9 4 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Hispanic Identity Fades Across Generations as Immigrant Connections Fall Away More than 18% of Americans identify as Hispanic or Latino, the nation’s second largest racial or ethnic group. But two trends – a long-standing high intermarriage rate and a decade of declining Latin American immigration – are distancing some Americans with Hispanic ancestry from the life experiences of earlier generations, reducing the likelihood they call themselves Hispanic or Latino. Among the estimated 42.7 million U.S. adults with Hispanic ancestry in 2015, nine-in-ten (89%), or about 37.8 million, self-identify as Hispanic or Latino. But another 5 million (11%) do not consider themselves Hispanic or Latino, according to Pew Research Center estimates. The closer they are to their immigrant roots, the more likely Americans with Hispanic ancestry are to identify 11 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org 27 16 15 12 9 Mixed background/Hispanic ancestry too far back Upbringing/No contact with Hispanic relatives Does not speak Spanish/ Has no cultural link Identifies as other race/ Does not look Hispanic Born in U.S./ Idenfities as American necessary to have a Spanish last name to be considered Hispanic, no matter their immigrant generation. Not all Americans with Hispanic ancestry self-identify as Hispanic Racial and ethnic identity in the U.S. since the 1960s has been based on self-reports: You are what you say you are.

The results are shown in Fig.12. The behavior is similar across classes, and while the model detects all instances when up to 50 are visible, it then starts saturating and misses more and more instances. Notably, when the image contains all 100 instances, the model only detects 30 on average, which is less than if the image contains only 50 instances that are all detected. The counter-intuitive behavior of the model is likely because the images and the detections are far from the training distribution. Note that this test is a test of generalization out-of-distribution by design, since there are very few example images with a lot of instances of a single class.

In this section, we analyze the behavior of DETR when approaching this limit. We select a canonical square image of a given class, repeat it on a 10 ×10 grid, and compute the percentage of instances that are missed by the model. To test the model with less than 100 instances, we randomly mask some of the cells. This ensures that the absolute size of the objects is the same no matter how many are visible.

Also note that for clarity, this code uses learnt positional encodings in the encoder instead of ﬁxed, and positional encodings are added by diﬀerent slots for all images in COCO 2017 val set. DETR learns diﬀerent specialization for each query slot. We observe that each slot has several modes of operation focusing on diﬀerent areas and box sizes. In particular, all slots have the mode for predicting image-wide boxes (visible as the red dots aligned in the middle of the plot). We hypothesize that this is related to the distribution of objects in COCO. Generalization to unseen numbers of instances.Some classes in COCO are not well represented with many instances of the same class in the same image. For example, there is no image with more than 13 giraﬀes in the training set. We create a synthetic image 3 to verify the generalization ability of DETR (see Figure 5).

Image features from the CNN backbone are passed through the transformer encoder, together with spatial positional encoding that are added to queries and keys at every multi- head self-attention layer. Then, the decoder receives queries (initially set to zero), output positional encoding (object queries), and encoder memory, and produces the ﬁnal set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes through multiple multi- head self-attention and decoder-encoder attention.

Some 3.9 million college- educated workers have health professions degrees, while 3.1 million have degrees in life or biological sciences. Fewer majored in computer science or related fields (1.8 million) or physical or earth sciences (1.7 million). Not all of these STEM-trained workers are employed in a STEM occupation, however. In fact, only about half of them are (52%).

The survey, which was conducted online in English and Spanish through GfK’s Knowledge Panel, included an oversample of employed adults working in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) jobs. Analysis of the survey data compares those working in STEM jobs with those in non-STEM jobs based on self-identified occupation.

About six-in-ten blacks working in STEM say they have experienced workplace discrimination because of their race Concerns about the underrepresentation of blacks and other racial minorities – and particularly women of color – in the STEM workforce have been ongoing for at least four decades.8 The Pew Research Center survey finds that, today, black STEM workers are especially likely to say they have experienced discrimination at work are equally likely to say they have experienced racial/ethnic workplace discrimination. These are some of the findings from a Pew Research Center survey with a nationally representative sample of 4,914 adults (including 2,344 STEM workers), ages 18 and older, conducted July 11-Aug. 2 Differences in reported discrimination in the workplace due to race between blacks in STEM vs. non-STEM jobs should be interpreted with caution due to the smaller number of black respondents in the survey (320 in total). Taking into account the design effect for these subgroups, the difference of 62% of blacks in STEM vs. 50% of blacks in non-STEM jobs saying they have experienced racial discrimination at work – whether in their current or previous jobs – for a two-tailed test is p=.075. Majority of blacks in STEM jobs have experienced discrimination at work % of those in science, technology, engineering and math 22 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org There are wide differences among STEM workers on the role of racial/ethnic discrimination in underrepresentation. Among blacks in STEM jobs, 72% say discrimination in recruitment, hiring and promotions is a major reason behind the underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics in these jobs. By contrast, 27% of whites and 28% of Asians say this, while 43% of Hispanics think discrimination is a major reason behind the underrepresentation. Similarly, there are wide differences between men and women working in STEM jobs on the role of gender discrimination. About half of women in STEM jobs (48%) say gender discrimination in recruitment, hiring and promotions is a major reason there are not more women in STEM jobs, compared with 29% of men in STEM jobs. When women and those in racial and ethnic minority groups working in STEM were asked to say, in their own words, the best ways to attract more people like themselves to STEM, many 83 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org believe that blacks are generally treated fairly in recruitment (43%) or in advancement opportunities (37%). By contrast most white STEM workers believe that blacks are usually treated fairly in these processes (78% say this about hiring, 75% about advancement opportunities). Similarly, there are wide differences in perceptions of fair treatment between Asians and whites working in STEM jobs, particularly in terms of advancement opportunities. About half of Asians in STEM jobs (53%) say that Asian Americans are usually treated fairly in opportunities for promotion and advancement. In contrast, 79% of white STEM workers believe this usually occurs. Some 59% of Hispanics working in STEM jobs say that Hispanics are usually treated fairly when it comes to promotion and advancement opportunities; in contrast, most whites in STEM jobs (74%) 15 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org And, blacks working in STEM jobs are less convinced than white STEM workers that black employees where they work are treated fairly when it comes to hiring and promotions. In all, 43% of blacks in STEM jobs believe that blacks where they work are usually treated fairly during recruitment; 37% say this is the case during promotion and advancement opportunities. By contrast most white STEM workers believe that blacks are usually treated fairly in these processes where they work (78% say this about hiring, 75% about advancement processes). Other Pew Research Center analyses found that black Americans with at least some college experience are more likely to say they have experienced discrimination or been treated unfairly across a range of experiences because of their race or ethnicity, compared with those without any college experience.

Diversity in the STEM workforce varies widely across jobs As the U.S. has transformed rapidly to an information-based economy, employment in science, technology, engineering and math occupations has grown – outpacing overall job growth. Since 1990, STEM employment has grown 79% (9.7 million to 17.3 million) and computer jobs have seen a whopping 338% increase over the same period. Using a broad definition of the STEM workforce, women make up half (50%) of all U.S. workers in STEM occupations, though their presence varies widely across occupational clusters and educational levels. Women account for the majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented in several other STEM occupational clusters, particularly in computer jobs and engineering. While there has been significant progress for women in the life and physical sciences since 1990, other workers – 6% of STEM workers are self-employed compared with 11% of non- STEM workers. (Workers in social science occupations and postsecondary education jobs, by contrast, are more likely to work in government and non-profit organizations.)17 See Appendix for details. 16 There is a small, statistically significant difference between these groups with 66.5% of those in STEM jobs working in private industry compared with 65.9% of those in non-STEM jobs. 17 The National Science Foundation’s Science and Engineering Indicators 2016 (chapter 3, appendix table 3-5) also finds that the private industry is by far the largest employer of the college-educated workforce of scientists and engineers. However, those with Ph.D.’s in a science and engineering field (including the social sciences) are most likely to be employed in four-year educational institutions (42%) and private knowledge.39 Of those who say their current job involves STEM, about two-in-ten (18%) work in management, while about one-in-ten (12%) work in business and finance operations. Men working in a non-STEM occupation are a bit more likely to say that they were ever interested in pursuing a career in STEM (43% vs. 35% of women in non-STEM jobs). There are no more than modest differences among whites (37%), blacks (41%) and Hispanics (45%) on this measure. Those who have or had an older family member working in STEM are modestly more likely than those who didn’t have an older family member in STEM to say they were once interested in a STEM job or career (48% vs. 36%).40 39 For more see National Science Board. 2014. “Revisiting the STEM Workforce: A Companion to Science and Engineering Indicators”\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: What is the percentage of workers employed in private, for-profit sectors in the field where the oldest woman advising on increasing diversity in STEM is employed?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for having this very important hearing. I have been involved with child nutrition since about 1954, when I became a teacher. I see people are there in the background that I have known since I have been here in Congress, 27 years. It is certainly a very, very impor- tant program. Some people forget that the program really began after World War II when it was discovered that many people entering the mili- tary in the draft at that time were physically unable to enter the military because of poor nutrition. Of course, many of them had grown up during the 1930’s, when we had the Great Depression. So it really became apparent to the Federal Government, Franklin my lunch. Mr. KILDEE. Very good. Well, you probably kept a very watchful eye on it. Chairman BOEHNER. I would have gladly given it to them. Mr. KILDEE. It was the quality then, right? But I finally caught the young man who was stealing the lunch. And stealing was not only considered a very serious crime in my family, but a sin. So I was going to turn him into the principal who would have suspended him for several weeks. But I found out that his mother was in no position to get him a breakfast in the morn- ing. And whenever he got to school, his first task was to find some- thing to eat. But then he said to me, he said, Mr. Kildee, I never steal the same lunch from the same person in the same week. And I figured, this kid has ethics. So I took him down to the cafeteria where we had no breakfast program, and said to Mrs. Pelkey, who was in charge of the cafeteria, ‘‘Mrs. Pelkey, Robert will be coming down here every morning for breakfast, and you get him something for here every morning for breakfast, and you get him something for breakfast and then send me a bill.’’ Well, he got breakfast for 3 years, and I never got a bill. But since then, of course, we have es- tablished breakfast programs in many schools. So I look forward to your hearing today. You are involved in something so important. Nutrition is so important. And the Federal Government has a great responsibility in this area. I look forward to your testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

In Food Distribution 2000, the panel rec- ommended that specifications be written to resemble, as close as possible, the specifications used in commercial food system procure- ment. I know the Department has reviewed some of these. But how are we coming in terms of the implementation of all of those rec- ommendations? Mr. Y ATES. Well, I think we have been very successful in imple- menting most of those. One of the issues that the Under Secretary and I both stated in our testimony is the substitution issue in re- gards to fruit and vegetables. It is fairly broad in substitution there. And it is limited when it comes to poultry and to beef and pork products. For the poultry products, if our inspectors are in the facility where we have continuous inspection, the company can be making either commercial or school product, and actually we allow them to use their own label on the product. And so if it has passed under I have been through every permutation that this program has gone under, cash in lieu of commodities, everything, every per- mutation of that.

Generally, LLM demon- strates high proficiency in transcribing problems into symbolic formats, evidenced by its near 100% Exe_Rate on ProntoQA, ProofWriter, and Logi- calDeduction. However, the high performance on these datasets is somewhat anticipated, given that their problems are mostly synthetically generated, limiting language variability. When it comes to datasets comprising real-world, expertly crafted problems, such as FOLIO and AR-LSAT, GPT- 4’s performance is notably less promising, with Exe_Rate scores of 79.9% and 32.6% respectively. This discrepancy underscores the inherent chal- lenges associated with converting real-world prob- lems into their logical equivalents.

We use the hardest fictional characters version of the dataset, based on the results in Saparov and He (2023). Each version is divided into different subsets depending on the number of reasoning hops required. We use the highest probability from LLMs. Since all examples are formed as multiple-choice questions, we eval- uate model performance based on the accuracy of selecting the correct answer. 3811 FOLIO (Han et al., 2022) is a challenging expert-written dataset for logical reasoning. The problems are mostly aligned with real-world knowl- edge and use highly natural wordings, and the ques- tions require complex first-order logic reasoning to solve. We use the entire FOLIO test set for evalua- tion, consisting of 204 examples. LogicalDeduction is a challenging logical rea- soning task from the BigBench (Srivastava et al., 2022) collaborative benchmark. The problems are mostly about deducing the order of a sequence of objects from a minimal set of conditions. We use the full test set consisting of 300 examples. AR-LSAT (Zhong et al., 2022) is a dataset that collects all analytical logic reasoning questions from the Law School Admission Test from 1991 to 2016. We use the test set which has 231 multiple- choice questions.

We have three major observations. 1. Logic-LM significantly outperforms stan- dard LLMs and CoT across all datasets. With GPT- 3.5, our method outperforms standard LLM on all datasets, with an average improvement of 39.2%. This highlights the benefit of combining LLMs with external symbolic solvers for logical reason- ing. LOGIC -LM also improves CoT by a large mar- gin of 18.4% on average, showing that offloading the reasoning to symbolic solvers greatly improves faithfulness compared with pure language-based reasoning with CoT. 2. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 by a large margin of 48.46% on average for the standard prompting. This aligns with the assertion that the main en- hancement of GPT-4 lies in its ability to carry out complex reasoning (OpenAI, 2023). Although this may indicate that the logical reasoning capability can be boosted by scaling up the LLM, we observe may indicate that the logical reasoning capability can be boosted by scaling up the LLM, we observe that GPT-4 still makes numerous unfaithful reason- ing errors. By delegating the reasoning to symbolic solvers, our method can further improve GPT-4 by an average of 24.98% and 10.44% for standard prompting and CoT prompting, respectively. 3. While integrating CoT generally enhances LLM performance, we find its benefits compara- tively less substantial or even negative on FOLIO, LogicalDeduction, and AR-LSAT, with a modest improvement of 11.75%, 9.41%, and -3.2%, re- spectively. On the contrary, the benefits of CoT on ProntoQA and ProofWriter are 51.59% and 33.82%, respectively.

First, LOGIC -LM relies on translating reasoning problems into logical formats that can be tackled by symbolic solvers. As a consequence, the model’s applicability is inherently bounded by the expres- siveness of the symbolic solver, for example, not all problems can be easily encoded in first-order logic. Nevertheless, this limitation can be mitigated by integrating a more diverse set of symbolic solvers. The flexible design of LOGIC -LM facilitates this integration. The wide range of reasoning tasks that we can instantiate our LOGIC -LM framework on shows its general applicability. Second, LOGIC -LM depends on in-context learning coupled with self-refinement to convert a natural language (NL) problem into the symbolic representation. While this method has proven to be effective, it may face difficulties when dealing with logical representations with intricate grammar structures, such as probabilistic soft logic. This its corresponding symbolic form, we use the for- mat SYMBOLIC _FORMULA ::: NL_ STATEMENT in in-context examples to enable better grounding. 3.2 Symbolic Reasoner After the problem formulator parses the problem P and the goal G into symbolic representations ˆP and ˆG, we call a deterministic external solver depending on the task, to obtain the answer A. Ta- ble 1 summarizes the symbolic solvers we use for each type of logical reasoning problem. LP System. For deductive reasoning, we incor- porate the Pyke expert system (Frederiksen, 2008), which makes inferences based on the logic pro- gramming language. In response to a query, Pyke first creates a knowledge base, populating it with known facts and rules. Subsequently, it applies forward- and backward-chaining algorithms to in- fer new facts and substantiate the goal. FOL Prover. We use Prover92 as the FOL in- ference engine.

To be specific, we define Si = (fi, Ai, Vi), where fi specifies the sub-task function fi ∈F, Ai is the argument passed to the function fi, and Vi is the variable that stores the returned result from the function call fi(Ai). For a valid reasoning program, the return value of the last reasoning step must be a Boolean value indicating the veracity label of the claim C, i.e., Vn ∈{TRUE, FALSE }. Program Execution. In the execution stage, the reasoning program P is run by an interpreter to derive the veracity label of the claim C. The in- terpreter sequentially parses the reasoning steps in P. For each step Si = (fi, Ai, Vi), it calls the cor- responding off-the-shelf sub-task function fi and passes the argument Ai to it. The argument Ai is ei- ther a logical expression or a natural language sen- 3-hop and 4-hop. This can be due to CoT generating free-form ex- planations, which can lead to unpredictable errors in long reasoning chains. In contrast, our program generation-and-execution strategy is more stable for longer reasoning chains. 5 Conclusion and Future Work We proposed PROGRAM FC, a few-shot neuro- symbolic model for fact-checking that learns to map input claims to a reasoning program consisting of a sequence of sub-task function calls for answer- ing a question, for fact-checking a simple claim, and for computing a logical expression. Then fact- checking is performed by executing that program. PROGRAM FC combines the advantages of sym- bolic programs, such as explainability, with the flexibility of end-to-end neural models. Using Codex as the program generator, PROGRAM FC demonstrates promising performance on HOVER and FEVEROUS with only a small number of in- context demonstrations and no additional training.

The program has a Python-like grammar, where each reasoning step is written in the format Vi = fi(Ai). At inference time, we prompt Codex with an instruction of the task, K in-context examples, and the input claim C.

We use K = 20to maintain a tradeoff between the diver- sity of reasoning types and the model’s maximum input capacity. We use sampling-based decoding (temperature of 0.7) to generate different reasoning programs for multiple runs. 3.4 Sub-Task Functions We implement three sub-task functions for the model to call during the program execution. •QUESTION : This sub-task function is a question- answering module that takes a question Q as the input argument and returns the answer A to the question. We use FLAN-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), an improved T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020) pretrained The generated reasoning program serves as a step-by-step guide for verifying the claim. We then execute the program by sequentially delegat- ing each sub-task to the corresponding sub-task handler, as shown in the functions columns in Fig- ure 1. These sub-tasks may include answering questions, verifying simple claims, or conducting logical reasoning. PROGRAM FC combines explainability with data efficiency. It uses reasoning programs to provide clear explanations of its reasoning process. For data efficiency, Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve various tasks given only a few exam- ples as prompts, e.g., in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020). We leverage this ability of LLMs to generate reasoning programs for a given claim by showing the model just a few dozen of (claim, pro- gram) pairs as demonstrations.

To be specific, we define Si = (fi, Ai, Vi), where fi specifies the sub-task function fi ∈F, Ai is the argument passed to the function fi, and Vi is the variable that stores the returned result from the function call fi(Ai). For a valid reasoning program, the return value of the last reasoning step must be a Boolean value indicating the veracity label of the claim C, i.e., Vn ∈{TRUE, FALSE }. Program Execution. In the execution stage, the reasoning program P is run by an interpreter to derive the veracity label of the claim C. The in- terpreter sequentially parses the reasoning steps in P. For each step Si = (fi, Ai, Vi), it calls the cor- responding off-the-shelf sub-task function fi and passes the argument Ai to it. The argument Ai is ei- ther a logical expression or a natural language sen- 3-hop and 4-hop. This can be due to CoT generating free-form ex- planations, which can lead to unpredictable errors in long reasoning chains. In contrast, our program generation-and-execution strategy is more stable for longer reasoning chains. 5 Conclusion and Future Work We proposed PROGRAM FC, a few-shot neuro- symbolic model for fact-checking that learns to map input claims to a reasoning program consisting of a sequence of sub-task function calls for answer- ing a question, for fact-checking a simple claim, and for computing a logical expression. Then fact- checking is performed by executing that program. PROGRAM FC combines the advantages of sym- bolic programs, such as explainability, with the flexibility of end-to-end neural models. Using Codex as the program generator, PROGRAM FC demonstrates promising performance on HOVER and FEVEROUS with only a small number of in- context demonstrations and no additional training. We also investigated the impact of model size and of Delegates appointment process .") label = Predict ( fact_1 and fact_2 ) # The claim is that <input_claim> def program (): Listing 2: The prompt used for Program Generation for FEVEROUS-S. 7002 consists of a claim and a program. The program has a Python-like grammar, where each reasoning step is written in the format Vi = fi(Ai). At inference time, we prompt Codex with an instruction of the task, K in-context examples, and the input claim C. Codex then attempts to complete the follow- ing texts, and thereby generates a program for C. The prompt template is shown in Figure 2.

As shown in Figure 3, we prompt the model differently de- pending on the settings defined in Section 3.1. For the closed-book setting, the input prompt is ferent settings of fact-checking, without affecting the rest of the system. We can allow the functions to retrieve information from external sources (in an open-book setting) or we can ask them to gen- erate answers based solely on the LLM’s internal parametric knowledge (in a closed-book setting). We evaluate PROGRAM FC on two challeng- ing datasets designed for fact-checking complex claims: HOVER (Jiang et al., 2020) and FEVER- OUS (Aly et al., 2021), and we show that it outper- forms seven few-shot fact-checking baselines on both datasets (§ 4.1).

It outperforms our PROGRAM FC on HOVER 2-hop and FEVEROUS but performs worse on HOVER 6988 However, this generalization becomes more chal- lenging as the complexity of the claims increases. On HOVER, the F1 score ofDeBERTaV3-NLI drops from 77.22 for 2-hop claims to 60.49 for 4-hop claims, which is a decrease of 21.7%. In contrast, the performance drop for ProgramFC, which uses the strategy of program-guided reasoning, is much smaller: just 11.7%. Decomposition is more effective than one-step prediction. The ProgramFC model, which uses the same FLAN-T5 model as the sub-task func- tions, outperforms the baseline of directly verify- ing claims with FLAN-T5 on all four datasets. On average, there is a 6.0% improvement in the gold evidence setting and a 4.5% improvement in the open-book setting. This suggests that decomposing a complex claim into simpler steps with a program can facilitate more accurate reasoning. This is es- pecially evident when the required reasoning is complex: there is a 14.9% improvement in the gold evidence setting and a 6.7% improvement in the Table 3: Closed-book setting: macro-F1 scores for PRO- GRAM FC and for the baselines.

Two main strategies are Generate-then-Rank and Feedback-Guided Decoding. Generate-then-Rank. This involves sampling a large number of candidate generations and sub- sequently picking up the best generation based on the feedback provided by the critic model, as illustrated in Figure 3(a). This approach is of- ten integrated with chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) to tackle complex reasoning tasks, such as solving math word problems. Given an input problem x, the LLM initially generates multiple candidate solutionsy1, ··· ,y n. Each so- lution yi =[ zi,a i] comprises a reasoning path (explanation) zi leading to the predicted answer ai. Subsequently, the critic model C assigns a plausibility score si to each candidate reason- ing path zi. The best solution is selected from the scored set (zi,a i,s i)n i=1 via either ranking or voting. Various critic models have been used for LLM The effectiveness of generation-time correction hinges on the critic model’s ability to give precise feedback for intermediate outputs, a challenging task in holistic NLP evaluations like summariza- tion. This motivates thepost-hoc correctionmeth- ods, where both critic and refinement models act only after generating the complete output. Post- hoc correction allows for more diverse natural lan- guage feedback, ranging from specific diagnostic reports to broader writing suggestions. As shown in Figure 4, we categorize the key post-hoc cor- rection strategies intoSelf-Correction, Correction with External Feedback,a n d Multi-Agent Debate. 491 Downloaded from http://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article-pdf/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00660/2369509/tacl_a_00660.pdf by guest on 23 May 2024\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: How many strategies are plotted for training-time generation, generation-time generation, and post-hoc generation, respectively?

Self-Correction. In ‘‘Self-Correction’’, a sin- gle LLM both generates and refines its output. As shown in Figure 4(a), the LLM first pro- duces an output and then acts as its critic for iterative refinements. This process continues un- til the output obtains an acceptable quality or a pre-specified number of iterations is reached. Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) introduced an effective framework using one LLM guided by varied prompts for the roles of generation, critic, and refinement, respectively.Clinical Self- Verification (Gero et al., 2023) applies this to extract clinical data, refining by spotting missing elements and verifying data accuracy.

However, it is important to acknowledge that the concept of automated correction is not new and has roots in early NLP research. To provide a complete historical perspective, we provide a succinct overview of these initial approaches to automated correction in Section 4.1. These studies are categorized based on the three strategies introduced in Section 2.4. We also sum- marize key features of each study, including: 1) the source of feedback, 2) the format of feedback, 3) the strategy and learning method employed for the refinement, 4) whether the refinement process is iterative, and 5) the application of the method. 3 Methodologies In this section, we delve into a detailed review of various correction methodologies. Depending on the time that the correction happens, we categorize them as Training-Time Correction, Generation- Time Correction,a n dPost-hoc Correction. 3.1 Training-Time Correction (Madaan et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023), a sepa- rately trained feedback model (Yang et al., 2022b; Paul et al., 2023), readily available external tools (Gou et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023e), to external knowledge sources such as Wikipedia or the in- ternet (Yu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b). Various strategies of correction have been proposed, in- cluding self-training (Huang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b), generate-then-rank (He et al., 2023; Weng et al., 2023), feedback-guided decoding (Yang et al., 2022a; Xie et al., 2023), iterative post-hoc revision (Zhang et al., 2023a; Jiang et al., 2023), etc. Recently, the incorporation of such strate- gies has demonstrated their effectiveness across a myriad of tasks, from question answering (Peng et al., 2023) and reasoning (Pan et al., 2023) to code generation (Zhang et al., 2023b) and toxicity detection (Lu et al., 2022). In light of these advancements, our paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey. We start by multi-modal LLMs, the incorporation of visual feedback, and improving vision-language tasks through self-correction. 6C o n c l u s i o n In this paper, we present a comprehensive sur- vey of self-correcting large language models with automated feedback. We categorize and ana- lyze various self-correction strategies, including training-time, generation-time, and post-hoc cor- rections. We also connect recent work with prior research and discuss the applicable scenarios for automated correction. Finally, we outline five po- tential future directions and associated challenges in this field. Our goal with this paper is to provide a comprehensive and useful resource for readers interested in the development of this rapidly evolving domain. To aid in this effort, we create a continually updated reading list in a GitHub repository as follows: https://github.com /teacherpeterpan/self-correction-llm -papers.

Figure 2: Three typical strategies of training-time correction: direct optimization with human feedback (a), trol during generation. Each output y is split into multiple reasoning steps y =[ o1,o 2, ··· ,o n].A critic model evaluates each step ot, guiding al- gorithms like beam search to explore the output space systematically and correct early mistakes. This strategy also helps alleviate the reason- ing inconsistencyproblem (Zelikman et al., 2022; Creswell and Shanahan, 2022),i.e., incorrect rea- soning leads to correct final answer. This strategy has been adopted in recent works like Tree-of- Thought (Yao et al., 2023a), GRACE (Khalifa et al., 2023), and RAP (Hao et al., 2023), which vary mainly in the critic model they employ, categorized into methods involving human feed- back, trained verifiers, external metrics, external knowledge, and self-evaluation. • Reward Model from Human Feedback: Stud- ies like Uesato et al. (2022) and Lightman et al. (2023) collect human-annotated step- level feedback to train a more robust re- ward model, which improves reasoning faithfulness. wise preferences between all possible answer pairs from individual LLMs and uses these preferences to generate a final ranking of models. In addition to reasoning tasks, LM vs LM (Cohen et al., 2023) employed this debate ap- proach for factual error detection, where a gener- ating LLM makes a claim and an examining LLM checks for inaccuracies. Extending its applicabil- ity, Fu et al. (2023) mimicked real-world human interactions, like a buyer-seller scenario, show- casing the versatility of multi-agent debates. 4 Discussion 4.1 Prior Research on Automated Correction In our survey, we primarily examine the auto- mated correction strategies in the era of modern large language models. However, the idea of ‘‘correcting the model with automated feedback’’ has been a longstanding practice in diverse NLP tasks. Recognizing these early works provides a deeper historical insight into the evolution of self- correction methods within NLP. Next, we briefly feedback, offering a multifaceted feedback approach. 3.4 Multi-Agent Debate Besides integrating tools, recent research has also explored the debate approach among multiple LLMs, inspired by the idea that multiple per- spectives can converge to an improved solution. Multiple LLM instances debate their individ- ual answers over several rounds, aiming for a consensus. Du et al. (2023) trialed this in arithmetic reason- ing. Agents, or LLM duplicates, present individual solutions and justifications. In the debate phase, these responses are aggregated and used as context for each agent to revise its original answer. After several iterations, they typically reach a consen- sus, showing superior performance compared to self-correction. PRD (Li et al., 2023c) furthered this by introducing the peer rank algorithm to optimize the consensus process. It considers pair- wise preferences between all possible answer pairs from individual LLMs and uses these preferences highlighted multi-agent debate as an effective method for automated correction in LLMs. How- ever, the observed improvement primarily stems from the model-driven voting process among dif- ferent LLMs, rather than from self-correction. This approach represents another successful in- stance of learning through external feedback, as each LLM benefits from the input provided by other LLMs in the debate. 5 Research Gaps and Future Directions 5.1 Theoretical Justifications\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: For the papers that adopted the Model Debate strategy in Table 2, how many of them are not mentioned in Section 3.4?

The milestones will be created by CELC in the student’s milestone page in EduRec AFTER the student has taken the DET and recommended by CELC to undergo the Graduate English Course (GEC). If the student is exempted from the English course AFTER DET (with BAND 3 result from DET), the GEC milestone will not show in his/her record in EduRec. If the GEC milestone appears in the student’s record in EduRec, it means that the student is required to proceed with the recommended level of English course. No exemptions are allowed thereafter. 2. The DET is a university-level requirement which must be fulfilled before graduation. 3. DET must be completed latest by the second semester of candidature. 4. Without DET, students are not allowed to attempt PhD Qualifying Examination (PQE) or to go for any overseas attachment such as the 2+2. 4.

Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Students may elect to have certain modules graded on a ‘Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory’ (S/U) basis. Withdrawn (W) When a student withdraws from a module between the first day of Week 3 of the instructional period and the last day of the Recess Week, a ‘W’ grade will be recorded in the transcript. Withdrawals after this period (i.e. from the first day of Week 7 of the instructional period) will result in an ‘F’ grade, which will be included in the computation of the CAP and will not be eligible for the S/U option.

Voters in 2016 found this presidential campaign to be far more negative than past elections and to include far less discussion of issues than usual. Almost across the board, voters saw this campaign as more negative than past elections. About nine-in-ten (92%) say there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning compared with previous contests, up from 68% who said that in 2012, up 38 points from 2008 (54% more negative) and 20 points higher than the previous high of 72% in 2004. Trump voters and Clinton voters overwhelmingly agree it was a more negative campaign than previous elections (90% and 95%, more negative campaign than previous elections (90% and 95%, respectively). On issues, about three-quarters of voters (73%) say there was less discussion of issues than in past elections, while just 23% say there was more talk of issues.

Just 30% of voters give Donald Trump a grade of A or B, 19% give him C, while half grade his conduct at either D (15%) or F (35%). Trump receives a C- grade on average.

Just 40% say “the voters” deserve a grade of A or B, 29% give them C, 15% D and 13% F. Still, on average, voters give themselves C, which is higher than grades they give other campaign actors aside from Clinton. Trump receives historically low grades overall (30% A or B), in part because his own supporters are not all that positive about his campaign conduct. While a majority Trump and Clinton voters grade the opposing party harshly: 49% of Clinton voters give a failing grade to the GOP, while 46% of Trump voters “fail” the Democratic Party. In 2012, just 32% of Romney voters gave the Democratic Party an F, while 23% of Obama supporters gave a failing grade to the Republican Party. Negative assessments of the way the press and pollsters conducted themselves in the campaign also are higher than in previous elections. Overall, 38% of voters give the press a failing grade – including 60% of Trump supporters. Voters who back Republican candidates have long been highly critical of the press, but this marks the first time a majority of any presidential candidate’s supporters has “failed” the press for its campaign conduct. In 2008, 44% of McCain voters gave the press a grade of F, as did 45% of Romney voters four years ago. Clinton supporters grade the press much more positively. Nearly four-in-ten (38%) give the press winner. Clinton receives an A or B from 43% of voters; 20% award Clinton a C, while nearly four-in-ten give Clinton a D (16%) or F (21%). Clinton’s average grade is a C. Few voters give high ratings to the political parties. Only about a quarter overall give the Republican Party (22%) and Democratic Party (26%) an A or B; roughly three-in-ten give each of the parties an F (30% for the Republican Party, 28% for the Democratic Party). On average, the GOP receives a D+, while the Democratic Party gets a C-. The press and pollsters also are viewed negatively for their performance during the campaign. Only 22% give the press an A or B grade; 38% give them a failing grade. For pollsters, just 21% give them an A or B, while three-in-ten (30%) give them an F.

Voters in 2016 found this presidential campaign to be far more negative than past elections and to include far less discussion of issues than usual. Almost across the board, voters saw this campaign as more negative than past elections. About nine-in-ten (92%) say there was more mudslinging or negative campaigning compared with previous contests, up from 68% who said that in 2012, up 38 points from 2008 (54% more negative) and 20 points higher than the previous high of 72% in 2004. Trump voters and Clinton voters overwhelmingly agree it was a more negative campaign than previous elections (90% and 95%, more negative campaign than previous elections (90% and 95%, respectively). On issues, about three-quarters of voters (73%) say there was less discussion of issues than in past elections, while just 23% say there was more talk of issues. Not since the 1996 election have so many voters said there was less discussion than in typical campaigns.

And voters do not spare themselves from criticism. Just 40% give “the voters” a grade of A or B – the lowest percentage after any election since 1996. As our surveys found throughout the campaign, voters view the 2016 contest as extraordinarily negative. Fully 92% say there was more “mudslinging” or negative campaigning than in past elections – which is 20 percentage points higher than the previous high (72% after the 2004 election). And while a large majority of voters (81%) feel they learned enough about the candidates to make an informed choice, a record 73% say that there was less discussion of issues compared with past presidential campaigns.

Public assessments of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak Three-quarters of Americans say that “not enough people following social distancing and mask- wearing guidelines” is a major reason the coronavirus outbreak has continued in the United States – the most commonly cited major reason among the six asked about in the survey. Roughly six-in-ten (58%) also say a major reason for the continued spread is that “restrictions on businesses and individuals have been lifted too quickly in some places.” About half of Americans (53%) say an inadequate federal government response is a major reason for the continuation of the outbreak, while nearly as many (49%) point to a lack of timely testing. Four-in-ten say a lack of clarity in instructions for how to prevent the spread is a major reason it has continued. Just 28% of Americans say a major reason is that it is “not possible to do much to control the spread.” 21% of Republicans say this (with nearly half – 45% – saying this is not a reason). Two-thirds of Democrats also say “not enough timely testing” is a major reason for the coronavirus outbreak continuing in the U.S., while fewer than half as many Republicans (30%) say the same. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say a major reason for the outbreak continuing is that it isn’t possible to do much to control the spread; still, just 35% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats say this. In a separate survey conducted earlier this summer, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say the Chinese government’s initial handling of the outbreak was to blame “a great deal” for the global spread of the coronavirus (73% vs. 38%), though wide majorities in both parties (90% of Republicans, 74% of Democrats) said this. Majorities of both partisan coalitions say ‘not enough’ social distancing a major reason outbreak continues 7 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org While most Americans express concern that states have been too quick to lift COVID-19 restrictions, three-quarters say a major reason the coronavirus outbreak has continued is that too few people are abiding by guidelines about social distancing and mask-wearing.

About half of Americans (53%) say an inadequate response by the federal government is a major reason the outbreak has continued, while nearly as many (49%) cite a lack of timely testing.

For instance, Republicans and Republican leaners living in places that have relatively low death rates and have not seen new deaths rise in recent months are 10 percentage points less likely than Republicans who live in other parts of the country to say that the most effective way forward for the nation’s economy is to reduce infection rates so that people feel comfortable going to stores, restaurants, schools and other workplaces (42% compared with 52%).

PIC's findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record in several important respects. 1. Personal Risk There is scant evidence in the record to support PIC's finding that Hanson was at risk personally in the Federal Case. PIC concluded that Hanson was at risk for damages and attorney's fees simply because DBE sued her individually. However, Dewey Beach hearing that the Clarifying Ordinance had “served a couple purposes.” One purpose was to clarify the meaning of the bulk standards to show that they did not relax the maximum 35 foot height limitation. The other purpose was to help Dewey Beach in the Fed\xad eral Case. Mandalas believed that by clarifying the meaning of bulk standards it would remove an issue in dispute in the Federal Case. Mandalas told PIC this at the hearing in response to PIC's legal counsel's question on the matter. The following is an excerpt of their exchange: Q.

PIC\'s findings of facts are reflected in the following state\xad ments: *12 This undisclosed purpose—not on the face of the ordinance—is at the heart of the allegation that she had a personal or private interest because she was personally sued by DBE. *16 PIC never conducted this analysis to deter\xad mine if the Clarifying Ordinance would be of any help to Hanson\'s qualified immunity defense.

Whether, as a member of the commission, somebody as a matter of policy thought it was good to go above 35 feet or not good to go about 35 feet, my view was that since we're in litigation, if we want to put on the best defense possible with that litigation, I did rec\xad ommend adoption of this ordinance. Thus, it is clear that Mandalas told the public that the purpose of the Clarifying Ordinance was to help Dewey Beach in the Federal Case. There is no evidence in the record suggesting that he told Hanson and the other individual defendants that the purpose of it was to help them personally. 3. Walton's Advice There is not substantial evidence in the record to support PIC's finding that Walton told Hanson that the Clarifying Ordinance would help her qualified immunity defense.

In both situations, the result- ing pathogenetic alterations depend on the physiological role played by the missing non-translated part or domain of the protein. If these roles are important in mediating functions of vital metabolic networks in the cell, then genetic defects will happen and the pathogenesis of a genetic disorder might ensue. 7.6.2.4. Re-sense mutation. In this type of arbitrarily deﬁned mutational event, the termination or stop codon at the end of the last exon of the gene might suffer a point mutation turning it to a functional codon. In this case, part of the un-translated region of the mRNA transcript will be included within the translation process which will continue with addition of more amino acids, not originally comprised in the protein sequence, till another stop codon is met with and is expanding progressively and includes many common and relevant genetic disorders like fragile X syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, some types of spino-cerebellar ataxia and many others. In this type of mutation, a normal deﬁned number of codons, triplets of nucleotides, along a speciﬁc segment of the gene increases in number when the gene is inherited. A threshold effect characterizes this dynamic mutational process. Within a certain range, we can identify a normal repeat num- ber in the normal gene, a larger repeat number in carriers or pre-mutation state and a much larger number in affected patients. For instance, the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1 gene) which is mutated in fragile X syndrome, regu- lates the synthesis of a protein, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) which acts, partly, as RNA binding protein that regulates in a global fashion cellular protein translation and micoRNA regulatory pathways, and has important func- The human transcriptome, being subjected to the same mutational events that can affect, alter and damage the DNA, seems to have efﬁcient anti-mutation mechanisms to guard against occurrence of errors during RNA transcription and to correct and repair some post-transcription defects of mRNA that can cause errors during protein translation. A separate RNA-proofreading system seems to exist and it probably acts during transcription by relying on the sequence complementarity information or database stored within the complementary silent or non-transcribing strand of DNA. Depending on the sequence of the active strand to ensure accurate transcription might result in improper transcription if mismatch errors occur due to, e.g. polymerase dysfunction. This assumption might, partly, explain the still un-understandable behavior of gene function which involves, seemingly needless, indirect and energy consuming mecha- nisms by transcribing a complementary mRNA molecule, deletion, results in the synthesis of an altered protein that loses its receptor function and can’t bind the HIV. Carriers of this beneﬁcial mutation are resistant to infection and genetic homozygosity of the mutation is known to confer protection against infection with the virus [3]. 7.6. Point, small, gross and genomic mutation Mutations are arbitrarily classiﬁed according to the size of affected component or region of the genome and the magni- tude of the mutational damage into point, small, gross and Figure 3 Triplet repeat expansion in fragile X syndrome. 6 M.S.Z. Salem acids, hence the term non-sense, so that no more amino acids are to be added to the growing polypeptide chain. Non-sense mutations result when a functional codon deﬁn- ing a speciﬁc amino acid is changed to a stop or termination codon. If base replacement results in the formation of a new stop or termination codon, for instance change of cytosine in (TAC) codon that deﬁnes tyrosine to adenine turns it to the stop codon (TAA) resulting in premature cessation of transla- tion and the production of a short or truncated protein. The resulting alterations depend on many factors. If the mutation happens at the beginning of the coding part of the gene, most of the protein coded by the gene will not be translated from this point on. A short, or truncated, mostly non-functional protein will be synthesized and marked deterioration of gene function might result.

Replacement of one base by another base may not affect the function of the gene or, on the other hand, can have drastic effects on gene function according to the type and func- tional consequences of the change. 7.6.2. Types of point mutations Five different types of point mutation can be delineated: same- sense, missense, non-sense, re-sense and frame shift point mutations. 7.6.2.1. Same-sense mutation.Due to degeneracy of the genetic code that allows for deﬁning the same amino acid by different codons, a point mutation might involve one base of a speciﬁc codon changing it to another codon, that still deﬁnes the same amino acid. For example, the amino acid leucine is deﬁned or dictated by six different codons, TTA–TTG–CTT–CTC–CT A–CTG. Replacement of one base of some of these codons, TTA to TTG, CTT to CTC or CTA to CTG, by another base does not change the speciﬁed amino acid, leucine, in the syn- thesized protein, hence the term same-sense because the same mits the occurrence of same-sense point mutations in func- tional codons without changing the amino acid deﬁned by the mutated codon. Since some amino acids, as a part of a 16 M.S.Z. Salem physiological alteration of the structure and/or function of the protein are expected and the pathogenesis of a genetic defect might ensue. 7.6.2.3. Non-sense mutation. The sixty-four codons of the genetic code include three codons that do not deﬁne or dictate any amino acids and are used by the gene to signal the end of the protein synthesis process in order to form the proper pro- tein with the proper number of amino acids. These codons (TAA–TGA–TAG) are termed stop or termination codons because they are recognized by both the mRNA transcript and the translation system as signals or markers of the end of the translation process since they do not deﬁne any amino Figure 4 Types & molecular mechanisms of point mutation. Pathogenetics 7 thesized protein, hence the term same-sense because the same amino acid is dictated by the new codon and no change in the synthesized protein results. 7.6.2.2. Mis-sense mutation. Due to the rigid rules of the genetic code, a change of one base of a codon might turn it into another codon that deﬁnes a different amino acid in the synthesized protein. If base replacement results in a new codon that speciﬁes a different amino acid, a mis-sense mutation results. For instance, a point mutation of the codon (TTT) or (thymine–thymine–thymine) that deﬁnes phenylalanine may change it to another codon (TCT) or (thymine–cyto sine–thymine) that deﬁnes serine. For protein translation sys- tem this change is considered as wrong code, hence the term missense, since it dictates a different amino acid. The effects of mis-sense mutation depend on the role played by the origi- nal amino acid in protein functioning, e.g. protein stability and aggregation. If it has important roles within fundamental the speciﬁc sequence of the nucleotides of the gene due to dele- tion or addition of nucleotide(s) followed by corresponding change of the amino acid sequence of the synthesized protein. Deletion or addition of one base within the gene will result in shifting of the reading frame of the newly formed codons. This type of point mutation is called frame-shift mutation. The resulting effects may lead to the formation of new same- sense, missense or stop termination codons with ultimate con- sequences similar to the results of the similar aforementioned mechanisms. These same rules apply for mutational events involving the addition or deletion of two bases. If three bases are added or deleted, a whole new codon will be added or removed, respectively. Whereas addition or deletion of one codon to a functional exon of the gene might result in a wide spectrum of alterations as previously explained, whole codon addition or deletion within non-coding parts of the gene,\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: What does a point mutation of the codon TTT or thymine-thymine define?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

Nuclear DNA repair Nuclear DNA repair mechanisms comprise many approaches to repair mutations of DNA. These approaches include differ- ent pathways and sub-pathways according to the type, site and extent of the mutation-induced damage and also according to the stage of cell cycle affected by the mutation. They include: base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair, transcription- coupled repair (TCR) and recombination repair ( Fig. 11 ). 10.7.1.1. Base excision repair (BER). This repair mechanism is probably the most frequent DNA repair pathway in the cell. It is used for single strand point mutations affecting one or few bases of one DNA strand. It involves recognition of the dam- containing oligonucleotides, a process called long-patch MMR. 10.7.1.5. Recombination repair. Recombination repair mecha- nisms aim primarily at repairing double-strand breaks of DNA which represent the most devastating mutation- induced lesions of DNA because they can lead to loss of genetic information and chromosomal instabilities with conse- quent pathological alterations including chromosome break- age syndromes and carcinogenesis. Double-strand breaks can be caused either endogenously during DNA replication due to replication errors, e.g. replication fork collapse, or exoge- nously by, e.g. ionizing radiation. Recombination repair mech- anisms consist of many various steps: end resection, strand invasion, DNA repair synthesis, branch migration and Holliday junction resolution, and include, at least, two differ- ent repair pathways: homologous recombination repair (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining repair. HR repair mechanism 10.7.1.2. Nucleotide excision repair (NER). Nucleotide exci- sion repair is one of the most important DNA repair systems and is highly conserved among species, though it is much more complicated in higher eukaryotes than prokaryotes. The most prominent feature of this repair system is its broad substrate speciﬁcity because it can excise DNA lesions such as UV- induced pyrimidine dimers as well as more bulky adducts of DNA. 10.7.1.3. Direct reversal repair. This repair mechanism can directly repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyl- transferase proteins, respectively. Direct reversal repair mech- anisms are not followed by incision of DNA strands or resynthesis of new DNA since the changed or mutated bases are directly reverted to their original states either by light- dependent photoreactivation process, for pyrimidine dimers repair, or by use of alkyltransferase.

This feature of mitochondrial genome allows for consid- erable burden of mutations to affect it before appreciable pathological consequences result. It is estimated that muta- tions affecting nearly 80% of certain mitochondrial genes might occur before pathological manifestations of mitochon- drial genetic diseases make their appearance due to this multi- ple copy feature of mtDNA [1]. 10.2. Structural features of DNA DNA exists as a double stranded structure composed of two tightly bound strands, each strand consisting of a straight sugar-phosphate backbone with opposing nitrogenous bases linked by glycosidic linkage to the sugar of one strand and by hydrogen bonds with a complementary base on the other strand. This speciﬁc structural organization of DNA serves many purposes. It stabilizes the dynamics of the molecule, per- mits replication and duplication of the genetic material, pro- tects the interiorly located bases and, most important, stores nisms exerted by mutated genes follows transposon-induced mutations. Tautomerism of bases of the DNA also accounts for a considerable fraction of spontaneous mutations of the genetic material. Changes of energy states of hydrogen bonds between complementary bases of DNA represent a third potential cause of spontaneous mutation. Alterations resulting from changes in electron resonance and/or proton transfer or relocation between the bonds can lead to tautomeric shift or tautomerization and momentary change of one base to another base, thus inducing point mutation, transition muta- tion [1]. The actual mechanisms underlying the occurrence of these changes are still largely undeﬁned, precisely. Analysis of DNA base dynamics according to quantum, rather than to Newtonian, principles seems essential for clarifying these mechanisms, and the concept of quantum biology, or studying the structure and function of the genetic material based on functional counterparts in eukaryotes and human cells.

Briefly describe how investment risks are reflected in the life cycle cost estimate and investment schedule: Section B: Risk Management (All Capital Assets) You should have performed a risk assessment during the early planning and initial concept phase of this investment\'s life-cycle, developed a risk-adjusted life-cycle cost estimate and a plan to eliminate, mitigate or manage risk, and be actively managing risk throughout the investment\'s life-cycle. Exhibit 300: Exhibit 300 - Integrated Personnel Management System (IPMS) (Revision 6) Tuesday, September 11, 2007 - 12:16 AM Page 15 of 15 The Life cycle cost estimate is risk adjusted to account for currently identified program risks and also takes into account the likelihood that additional risks will materialize throughout the project life cycle. The project schedule is based on a conservative estimate of the time required to maintain and implement new applications within IPMS. A detailed analysis of the program\'s subprojects ("bottoms-up" analysis), taking into account lessons learned, is conducted by management and subject matter experts to assess the current and future level of effort required to meet the investment\'s objectives. This more conservative approach uses realistic expectations, rather than best case scenarios to develop the investment\'s budget and schedule.

Coreset [ 41] works very well as its original form because this querying strategy has implicitly considered the label diversity (also veriﬁed in Table 2) by formulating a K-center problem, which selects Kdata points to represent the entire dataset. Some results are missing (marked as “-”) because the querying strategy fails to sample at least one data point for each class. Results of more sampling ratios are presented in Appendix Figures 6, 9.

For contrastive learning, we trained 200 epochs with MoCo v2, following its default hyperparameter settings. We set τ to 0.05 in equation 2. To reproduce the large batch size and iteration numbers in [13], we apply repeated augmentation [21, 49, 50] (detailed in Table 5).

Hard-to-contrast data. We consider the data with a low conﬁdence value (Equation 3) as “hard-to- contrast” because they are seldom predicted correctly in the instance discrimination task. Apparently, if the model cannot distinguish a data point with others, this data point is expected to carry typical characteristics that are shared across the dataset [40]. Visually, hard-to-contrast data gather in the bottom region of the Dataset Maps and “easy-to-contrast” data gather in the top region. As expected, hard-to-learn data are more typical, possessing the most common visual patterns as the entire dataset; whereas easy-to-learn data appear like outliers [ 54, 26], which may not follow the majority data distribution (examples in Figure 3a and Figure 3c). Additionally, we also plot the original Dataset 2.2 Intra-class Criterion: Querying Hard-to-Contrast Data to Avoid Outliers Dataset map. Given Kclusters generated from Criterion #1, we now determine which data points ought to be selected from each cluster. Intuitively, a data point can better represent a cluster distribution if it is harder to contrast itself with other data points in this cluster—we consider them typical data. To ﬁnd these typical data, we modify the original Dataset Map3 by replacing the ground truth term with a pseudo-label term. This modiﬁcation is made because ground truths are unknown in the active learning setting but pseudo-labels are readily accessible from Criterion #1. For a visual comparison, Figure 3b and Figure 3c present the Data Maps based on ground truths and pseudo-labels, respectively. Formally, the modiﬁed Data Map can be formulated as follows.

Figure 6 Training loss curves forChameleon models under various settings. In Figure 5b, we show training loss curves forChameleon-7B with and without QK-Norm, and the latter diverges after approximately 20% of a training epoch. We found that to stabilizeChameleon-7B by controlling norm growth, it was necessary to introduce dropout representation range of bf16 (In Figure 6b, we show that ablations without image generation did not diverge). In a unimodal setting, this problem has also been named the logit drift problem (Wortsman et al., 2023). In Figure 5a, we plot the norms of the output of the last transformer layer as training progresses and we find that although training divergences can manifest after as much as even 20-30% of training progress, monitoring uncontrolled growth of output norms is strongly correlated with predicting future loss divergence. The softmax operation appears in two places in transformers: the core attention mechanism and the softmax over the logits. As inspired by Dehghani et al. (2023) and Wortsman et al. (2023), we first deviate from the Llama architecture by using query-key normalization (QK-Norm). QK-Norm directly controls the norm growth of input to the softmax by applying layer norm to the query and key vectors within the attention. 6 but not forChameleon-34B (see Figure 5c and 6c). The application of QK-Norm while helping the inner softmaxes within the Transformer does not solve the problem of logit shift in the final softmax. Following Chowdhery et al. (2022); Wortsman et al. (2023), we applyz-loss regularization. Specifically, we regularize the partition functionZ of the softmax function σ(x)i = exi Z where Z = P i exi by adding10−5 log2 Z to our loss function. ForChameleon-7B it was important to use both dropout andz-loss to achieve stability, whileChameleon-34B only requiredz-loss (Figure 6c). Chameleon-7B was trained with a global batch size of223 (∼ 8M) tokens andChameleon-34B was trained with a global batch size of3 × 222 (∼ 12M) tokens. We do 2.1 epochs over our full training dataset for a total 7 after the attention and feed-forward layers, in addition to QK-norm (see Figure 5c). However, this recipe was not enough to stabilitize,Chameleon-34B, which required an additional re-ordering of the norms. Specifically, we use the strategy of normalization proposed in Liu et al. (2021), within the transformer block. The benefit of the Swin transformer normalization strategy is that it bounds the norm growth of the feedforward block, which can become additionally problematic given the multiplicate nature of the SwiGLU activation function. If h represents the hidden vector at time-stept after self-attention is applied to inputx, Chameleon-34B: h = x + attention_norm(attention(x)) output = h + ffn_norm(feed_forward(h)) Llama2: h = x + attention(attention_norm(x)) output = h + feed_forward(ffn_norm(h)) There was no difference in perplexity when training a model from scratch with and without the normalization\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: At which step, the loss spikes when without QK-norm?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

Most prominently, 68% of Americans think using the personal finance score concept is unacceptable, and 67% think it is unacceptable for companies to conduct computer-aided video analysis of interviews when hiring job candidates. The survey asked respondents to describe in their own words why they feel these programs are acceptable or not, and certain themes emerged in these responses. Those who think these programs are acceptable often focus on the fact that they would be effective at doing the job they purport to do. Additionally, some argue in the case of private sector examples that the concepts purport to do. Additionally, some argue in the case of private sector examples that the concepts simply represent the company’s prerogative or the free market at work. Meanwhile, those who find the use of these programs to be unacceptable often worry that they will not do as good a job as advertised. They also express concerns about the fairness of these programs and in some cases worry about the privacy implications of the data being collected and shared. The public reaction to each of these concepts is discussed in more detail below. Automated personal finance score Among the 31% of Americans who think it would be acceptable for companies to use this type of program, the largest share of respondents (31%) feel it would be effective at helping companies find good customers. Smaller shares say customers have no right to complain about this practice since they are willingly putting their data out in public with their online activities (12%), or that higher than the share of either whites (49%) or Hispanics (38%) who say the same. The public is mostly divided on whether these programs would be effective or not The public is relatively split on whether these programs would be effective at doing the job they are designed to do. Some 54% think the personal finance score program would be effective at identifying good customers, while around half think the parole rating (49%) and resume screening (47%) algorithms would be effective. Meanwhile, 39% think the video job interview concept would be a good way to identify successful hires. For the most part, people’s views of the fairness and effectiveness of these programs go hand in hand. Similar shares of the public view these concepts as fair to those being judged, as say they would be effective at producing good decisions. But the personal finance score concept is a notable exception to this overall trend. Some 18 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org The 41% of Americans who think it is acceptable for companies to use this type of program give three major reasons for feeling this way. Around one-in-five (19%) find it acceptable because the company using the process would save a great deal of time and money. An identical share thinks it would be more accurate than screening resumes by hand, and 16% feel that companies can hire however they want to hire. Some examples: ▪ “Have you ever tried to sort through hundreds of applications? A program provides a non-partial means of evaluating applicants. It may not be perfect, but it is efficient.” Woman, 65 ▪ “While I wouldn’t do this for my company, I simply think it’s acceptable because private companies should be able to use whatever methods they want as long as they don’t illegally discriminate.

Attitudes toward algorithmic decision-making Today, many decisions that could be made by human beings – from interpreting medical images to recommending books or movies – can now be made by computer algorithms with advanced analytic capabilities and access to huge stores of data. The growing prevalence of these algorithms has led to widespread concerns about their impact on those who are affected by decisions they make. To proponents, these systems promise to increase accuracy and reduce human bias in important decisions. But others worry that many of these systems amount to “weapons of math destruction” that simply reinforce existing biases and disparities under the guise of algorithmic neutrality. This survey finds that the public is more broadly inclined to share the latter, more skeptical view. Roughly six-in-ten Americans (58%) feel that computer programs will always reflect the biases 2 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org Algorithms are all around us, utilizing massive stores of data and complex analytics to make decisions with often significant impacts on humans. They recommend books and movies for us to read and watch, surface news stories they think we might find relevant, estimate the likelihood that a tumor is cancerous and predict whether someone might be a criminal or a worthwhile credit risk. But despite the growing presence of algorithms in many aspects of daily life, a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults finds that the public is frequently skeptical of these tools when used in various real-life situations. This skepticism spans several dimensions.

In 1921, Burr and Buck (1921) claim that “Hamilton is the only county in Nebraska, or probably in any other state, that has a farmers’ elevator at every railroad station.”50 Today, grain elevators in Hamilton County’s communities can be seen for miles away, are the largest structures, and serve as one of each town’s focal points (HM02-020, HM04-023, and HM06-032). Grain Elevator, Giltner (HM02-023). Grain Elevator, Hordville (HM04-023). Grain Elevator, Marquette (HM06-032). Hamilton County Towns Like many regions in the Midwest and Great Plains, many of the county’s original towns are no longer present. These small communities have been moved or replaced as populations have shifted in relation to changing economic issues and changing transportation patterns. Baltensperger contends that “town development became heavily dependent on rail connections, as a Hamilton County Historic Building Survey current populations. Pat Dinslage (1992) in the Grand Island Independent discusses population issues in Hordville (population 150) and Polk (population 322) and contends that both “are dependent upon the surrounding farming community” and likely to see continued population declines. Selecting the County Seat of Government Great Plains scholar Bradley Baltensperger (1985) contends that “disputes over county seats were the wars of frontier Nebraska. Fraudulent elections to select a county seat might be followed by theft of the county records, showdowns, court battles, and more thefts of records.” 56 To a large degree, Hamilton County’s eventual selection of Aurora matches Baltensperger’s description. Orville City, which had been surveyed and recorded in 1870 and located on the West Blue River, was selected in 1871 as Hamilton County’s first seat of government. That distinction would not last the county.

By 2002, the number of farms had declined to 603 and the average size had increased to 577 acres. 41 Hamilton County annually receives approximately twenty-six inches of precipitation, sufficient for wheat, sorghum, and range grasses. For decades, this total has played a significant part in Hamilton 6 Executive Summary The Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) contracted with H. Jason Combs (PI), Anne Bauer, and John Bauer to conduct a Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey (NeHBS) of Hamilton County. The survey was conducted in the summer and fall of 2008 to document properties that possess historic or architectural significance. Hamilton County was previously surveyed in 1984—at that time 546 properties were identified and recorded. The properties were resurveyed in addition to the 183 newly identified and documented properties. Within the report, when a surveyed building is mentioned, its NeHBS site number follows its reference in the text (for example, HM01-114). These site numbers begin with an abbreviation for the county, HM for Hamilton County, and a two-digit number referring to its location with the county. Each community has a specific number, for instance, Marquette is “06” and rural the county reached its highest population ever at 14,096. Since that peak Hamilton County’s population has slowly declined, (Table 1). As the population surged in the late 1800s numerous rural school districts were created. Each district Table 1.

In 1921, Burr and Buck (1921) claim that “Hamilton is the only county in Nebraska, or probably in any other state, that has a farmers’ elevator at every railroad station.”50 Today, grain elevators in Hamilton County’s communities can be seen for miles away, are the largest structures, and serve as one of each town’s focal points (HM02-020, HM04-023, and HM06-032). Grain Elevator, Giltner (HM02-023). Grain Elevator, Hordville (HM04-023). Grain Elevator, Marquette (HM06-032). Hamilton County Towns Like many regions in the Midwest and Great Plains, many of the county’s original towns are no longer present. These small communities have been moved or replaced as populations have shifted in relation to changing economic issues and changing transportation patterns. Baltensperger contends that “town development became heavily dependent on rail connections, as a 1960 2,576 293 331 128 210 192 69 1970 3,180 408 387 147 239 341 65 1980 3,717 400 419 155 303 405 68 1990 3,810 367 432 164 281 316 64 2000 4,225 389 439 150 282 336 60 Year Aurora Giltner Hampton Hordville Marquette Phillips Stockham 430 Source: www.census.gov. 9 Hamilton County Historic Building Survey current populations. Pat Dinslage (1992) in the Grand Island Independent discusses population issues in Hordville (population 150) and Polk (population 322) and contends that both “are dependent upon the surrounding farming community” and likely to see continued population declines. Selecting the County Seat of Government Great Plains scholar Bradley Baltensperger (1985) contends that “disputes over county seats were the wars of frontier Nebraska. Fraudulent elections to select a county seat might be followed by theft of the county records, showdowns, court battles, and more thefts of records.” 56 To a large degree, Hamilton County’s eventual selection of Aurora matches Baltensperger’s description. Orville City, which had been surveyed and recorded in 1870 and located on the West Blue River, was selected in 1871 as Hamilton County’s first seat of government. That distinction would not last that small towns are on the verge of In regard to population, Hamilton disappearing. Furthermore, Aurora peaked County’s towns have demonstrated a in population at the most recent census in number of trends (Table 3). Five of the 2000 with 4,225 citizens and has steadily seven rural communities peaked in increased since 1940 (Table 3). However, as population between 1900 and 1940, which is farm consolidation continues it is most typical of most small towns in the Midwest likely that Hamilton County’s towns, outside and Great Plains.

Author:Leo Medina n/a n/a as substantial writing, reading, and listening (videos and unit pod-cast). • In the first video, students are introduced to modern businesses and corporations which are often built on greed and corruption rather than ethical practices. • The second video highlights the importance in creating ethical businesses.

The comparison between MMMU and other existing benchmarks. MMMU excels in both its breadth to cover a wide range of disciplines and its depth to test LMMs’ reasoning abilities. In the image format, V means visual input, OC means optical characters, MC means multi-choice. Repurposed means the benchmark is a compilation of prior datasets. the annotators are advised to select questions without im- mediately available answers, such as those with answers in difficulty levels: very easy, easy, medium, and hard. Ap- proximately 10% of the problems, classified as very easy and not aligning with our design criteria due to their sim- plistic nature, are excluded from the benchmark. This rig- orous process plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and difficulty of the problem set. 3.3. Comparisons with Existing Benchmarks To further distinguish the difference between MMMU and other existing ones, we elaborate the benchmark details in Figure 4. From the breadth perspective, the prior bench- marks are heavily focused on daily knowledge and com- mon sense. The covered image format is also limited. Our benchmark aims to cover college-level knowledge with 30 image formats including diagrams, tables, charts, chemi- cal structures, photos, paintings, geometric shapes, music sheets, medical images, etc. In the depth aspect, the previ- ous benchmarks normally require commonsense knowledge MMMU: A Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI Supplementary Material Table of Contents in Appendix A .

Error distribution over 150 annotated GPT-4V errors. the “Medium” category, while the gap narrows, GPT-4V still leads at 55.6%. The further diminishing performance gap in the “Hard” category across models indicates that as the complexity of tasks increases, the advantage of more ad- vanced models like GPT-4V almost disappears. This might reflect a current limitation in handling expert-level chal- lenging queries even for the most advanced models. 5. Error Analysis and Future Work In this section, we delve into the analysis of errors by GPT- 4V , a pivotal aspect for understanding its operational ca- pabilities and limitations. This analysis serves not only to identify the model’s current shortcomings but also to guide future enhancements in its design and training. We meticu- lously examine 150 randomly sampled error instances from lously examine 150 randomly sampled error instances from GPT-4V’s predictions. These instances are analyzed by ex- pert annotators who identify the root causes of mispredic- tions based on their knowledge and the golden explanations if available. The distribution of these errors is illustrated in Figure 6, and a selection of 100 notable cases, along with detailed analyses, is included in the Appendix. Perceptual Errors (35%): Perceptual errors, forming the bulk of the inaccuracies in the GPT-4V model, are catego- rized into two types: basic perceptual errors and domain- specific perceptual errors. Basic perceptual errors, as de- picted in Figure 7, occur when the model accurately pro- cesses and understands the given information but fails in elementary visual interpretation, such as misjudging the se- quence described as “from left to right, top to bottom.” On the other hand, domain-specific perceptual errors occur due to the lack of knowledge.

Analogous setups. We should construct increasingly analogous empirical setups, and we should enumerate any remaining disanalogies. A setup is analogous if our results on that setup do not rely on assumptions that will break down in the future, making results today likely qualitatively similar to results in the future. Our main evaluation setup, introduced in Section 3, is intended to be more analogous to the superalignment problem. We enumerate some remaining disanalogies with our setup in Section 6.1. Enumerating assumptions. We should enumerate the key assumptions that our results (either implicitly or explicitly) rely on. Clarifying what assumptions we are making makes it much easier to know when our results might break down. We enumerate our main disanalogies and assumptions in Section 6.1 and Appendix G.3.

Hue indicates compute of weak supervision. Stars indicate points where weak supervisor size corresponds to sample difficulty cutoff. (see Appendix A.2). Consequently, the puzzle Elo is a high-quality but still imperfect measure of difficulty of the problem for humans. It is also important to note, that puzzle Elo may not be a good measure of difficulty for the models: easy puzzles for humans can be hard for the models and vice versa. We then split the dataset into subsets according to the puzzle Elo. We consider the hard set to be puzzles with difficulty above Elo 2000. For the easy set, we consider cuttoffs in {800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300}, and use puzzles with difficulty below the cutoff. We also con- sider the unrestricted set of all puzzles.

Suppose models W1, W3, W4 predict the example correctly when it is in a held-out set, while W2 predicts it incorrectly. Then we will assign a difficulty of C3 to the example. Then given a difficulty cutoff D, we filter the training set to examples with difficulty ≤ D. We subsample the filtered set so that the number of training examples is equal to the number of examples at the lowest difficulty level. We train a model on the subsampled training set using ground truth labels, and measure its accuracy on a held out test set (with no subsampling). The subsampling ensures that we use the same training set size for each difficulty cutoff. Using ground truth labels ensures that the label accuracy is the same ( 100%) for each cutoff.

PEW RESEARCH CENTER 11 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org EMBARGOED COPY – NOT FOR PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION UNTIL 2:00 p.m. EDT, APRIL 22, 2021 When it comes to voting policies, younger people are typically more likely than older people to favor increased ballot access, whether that is through automatic voter registration, disapproval of removing voters from registration lists if they have not recently voted, allowing ex-convicts to vote, or making Election Day a national holiday. This difference is primarily driven by age differences among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. About one-in-three Republicans ages 65 and older (32%) favor policies that would automatically register all eligible citizens to vote, as do 35% of Republicans ages 50 to 64, 41% of those 35 to 49 and 46% of Republicans younger than 35. There is almost no age difference among Democrats on this proposal. Similar age dynamics can be seen across a range of voting proposals. Younger 9 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pewresearch.org EMBARGOED COPY – NOT FOR PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION UNTIL 2:00 p.m. EDT, APRIL 22, 2021 While the public broadly supports six of the seven voting proposals asked about on the survey, there are sizable partisan divides on several policies – including the relative strength of support for many election issues. For example, while majorities of Democrats and Republicans say they favor making early, in- person voting available to voters for at least two weeks prior to Election Day, Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to strongly support this measure (65% vs. 26%, respectively). There is a similar pattern in views when it comes to making Election Day a national holiday (53% of Democrats strongly support this policy compared with 29% of Republicans) and whether people convicted of felonies should be able to vote after serving their sentences (49% of Democrats strongly favor vs. 20% of Republicans). than are Democrats of other races and ethnicities, while the reverse is true for White Republicans compared with Hispanic Republicans. Among all adults, those with a college degree or more education are more likely to support no-excuse early and absentee voting than those with less education (74% vs. 57%). Partisanship remains the most important factor in Americans’ attitudes about this question, with only 38% of Republicans in favor of allowing all voters to vote early or absentee Black adults more likely than White, Hispanic and Asian adults to favor ‘no excuse’ early, absentee voting Which statement comes closer to your own views – even if neither is exactly right?

The survey also finds that while Republicans and Democrats both have negative views of China and are critical of Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus, this criticism is more prevalent among Republicans. Republicans and Republican- leaning independents are significantly more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to have a very unfavorable view of China, to criticize the Chinese government’s role in the global pandemic, and they often want to take a tougher policy approach to the country.

In addition to the petition requirement, pr ospective candidates for non-statewide office must file a notice of candidacy and submit a qualifying fee. Id. § 21-2-132(d). For most offices, including U.S. Representative, the fee is 3% of the office’s annual salary. Id. § 21-2-131(a)(2). A candidate who cannot afford the fee may file a pauper’s affidavit instead, which requires an affirmation under oath of an inability to pay, a financial statement, and a signed petition. Id. § 21-2-132(g)–(h). 1 Under Georgia law, a “political party” is a political organization that at the preceding general ele ction for governor or president nominated a candidate that received at least 20% of the total vote cast.

We view the facts “in the light most favorable to the non- moving party on each motion.” Id. III. The Libertarian Party first claims that Georgia’s ballot-access laws unconstitutionally burden two overlapping rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments: “the right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs” and “the right of qualified voters, regardless of their political persuasion, to cast their votes effectively .” Anderson v.

Nor does it contend that this judicial -review mechanism is inadequate to correct any erroneous petition denials. And most importantly, it provides no information about how validation rates have changed since Jenness. The Party’s reliance on increased campaign -finance restrictions also falls short. While federal law now caps the amount that donors can contribute to petitioning efforts, the Party has not connected those contribution limits to any materially heightened burden. See 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a). For instance, it has made no showing that prospective candidates could not gain contributions from additional donors, or that the Party would donate more to its candidates if it were not barred from doing so.

During pre-training, only LoRA parameters are optimized. Other Details can be found in Appendix G. 4.4.2 Results. As shown in Table 3, we find that: 1) Once trained on LLM-LR, the performance of LlaMA2-13B and Vicuna-13B im- proves greatly compared with that of Table 1 and 2, especially on the baselines without logical constraints. 2) The performance of LlaMA2-13B-PT could even surpass that of some greater LLMs (e.g., provided demonstrates to output the expected format of answers for subsequent automatic evaluation. Besides, the whole process does not require any gradient update, allowing LLMs to generate predictions without massive training data. Compared Models. We choose three variants of ChatGPT (gpt- turbo, text-davinci-003, and gpt4), Vicuna-13B-v1.3, and Llama2-13B as the main experimental LLMs for evaluation. We also provide two fine-tuning RoBERTa-large baselines (one-shot and fully fine-tuned) for comparison. The training details of RoBERTa- large can be found in Appendix B.2. Dataset Construction. Our main experiments are evaluated on MAVEN-ERE, Causal-TimeBank [28], and ProofWriter. For the ERE task, we focus on relations between two events and conduct sam- pling at the sentence level.

We color in orange words about how to get the estimand, and we use the orange circle to include all the non-descendants of X. C.3 Causal Inference Methods We introduce do-calculus which can downgrade the Rung-2 queries to Rung-1 quantities when it is applicable, and counterfactual predictions which downgrade the Rung-3 queries. C.3.1 Do-Calculus Do-Operator as a Notation As mentioned in Rung 2, the do-operator is a convenient notation to represent an intervention on a variable. For example, do(X = x) sets the value of variable X to x. Three Inference Rules for Climbing the Ladder Do-calculus is a set of rules that allows us to answer higher-rung questions using lower-rung quantities, such as probability distributions of Rung 1. for future research. 2 Preliminaries on Causal Inference Our dataset design takes inspiration from the Causal Inference Engine as postulated by Pearl and Mackenzie [66], see also [59]. We begin with a brief overview of the causality framework by Pearl et al. [67].4 This framework was largely developed within the field of artificial intelligence, and there- fore puts particular emphasis on algorithmic aspects of causal reasoning (e.g., [62])—which makes it particularly suited for our work, where we want to algorithmically generate ground truth answers to causal queries, without having to appeal to common sense to assess the correctness of an answer. 2.1 The Ladder of Causation The Ladder of Causation, introduced by Pearl and Mackenzie [66], is a proposed taxonomy, and hierarchy, of causal inference tasks [3]. It consists of three distinct rungs. Rung 1 (“seeing”). This describes statistical associations (“How often do I take an aspirin when inference approach described by Pearl [61], based on graphical models and structural causal models (SCMs) [23, 59, 61, 69, 88]. We compose more than 10,000 causal questions that cover a variety of causal queries across the three rungs of the Ladder of Causation [3, 66]—i.e., associational (Rung 1), interventional (Rung 2), and counterfactual (Rung 3). We consider several causal graphs, giving rise\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: What rung is the second ladder of causation refer to?\n                ` does not exist." type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

To generate all the causal graphs and CGTEs here, we iterate all commonly used ones within four nodes in the CI books, and omit CGTEs whose solution by CI methods trivially resembles existing ones. A.4 Data Coverage Starting from the full set of 12 distinct causal graphs and 10 query types, there are a few combinations that must be omitted as the ground truth answer would be trivial or ill-defined. For example, in the “Immorality” graph, the treatment “X” and outcome “Y” are by construction statistically independent, so there correlation is necessarily 0. Similarly, there are several graphs where certain causal queries are ill-defined or don’t make sense to ask. Specifically: 1. For the Natural Direct Effect, we only include questions on the “IV”, “Arrowhead”, “Con- A: [LLM final answer] C Additional Technical Background for Preliminaries C.1 Graphical Models We adopt the causal inference framework described in [61]. A causal graph G := (V , E) consists of a set of k vertices V : {V1, . . . , Vk} and directed edges E := {eij}, where the existence of each eij means that there is a direct causation from Vi to Vj, also denoted as Vi → Vj. We also introduce some notations to describe the relative positions among the nodes. Following a standard assumption in causality (but see, e.g., [6]), we will assume that G is a direct acyclic graph (DAG), where we denote the parents of a node Vi as PA(Vi) := {Vj|eij ∈ E}. We denote descendants DE(Vi) := {Vj|Vj → ··· →Vi ∈ E} of a node Vi as all the nodes that have at least one direct path leading to a node. We call a node Vk as a confounder (i.e., common cause) of the other two nodes Vi and Vj if eki, ekj ∈ E; a collider (i.e., common effect) if eik, ejk ∈ E; and a mediator if eik, ekj ∈ E. information”.

We compare Anchoring Re-weighting with two baselines: (1) Vanilla ICL with the same demon- stration (1-shot per class) (2) Vanilla ICL, where the auxiliary training set of β is included as demon- strations (5-shot per class) for a fair comparison. 3.1.3 Results As Table 1 shows, the proposed anchor re- weighting significantly enhances ICL performance, particularly on the SST-2 and EmoC datasets. Be- sides, adding more demonstrations for vanilla ICL may not bring a stable accuracy boost due to the po- tential noise introduced, as discussed in Zhao et al. (2021). Different from vanilla ICL which utilizes the extra examples to form a demonstration, we train a re-weighting vector β to modulate label an- chor contributions. This shortens the input context and thus brings (almost) no extra cost to the infer- ence speed. The consistent improvements of our method suggest that the re-weighting mechanism could be a better alternative to utilize demonstra- Drawing on insights from the information flow perspective, we explore three approaches to en- hance ICL’s effectiveness, efficiency, and inter- pretability. (1) An anchor re-weighting method is introduced, which employs a learnable vector to adjust the significance of different label words in demonstrations, leading to a 16.7% average accu- racy boost compared to standard ICL baselines. (2) For quicker ICL inference, inputs are compressed into pre-calculated anchor representations since model predictions primarily rely on label word acti- vations. Testing shows a 1.8× speedup in inference with only a minimal performance trade-off. (3) An error analysis of ICL on GPT2-XL demonstrates that the label confusion matrix aligns closely with the distance distribution of anchor key vectors, im- plying that errors might result from similar anchor representations. These promising applications fur- ther validate our hypothesis and shed light on future ICL studies for better transparency of LLMs. layers assemble information from demonstrations via label words to form semantic representations. In § 2.3, we verify that the aforementioned aggre- gated information on label words is then extracted to form the final prediction in the deep layers. Rec- ognizing the crucial function of label words in this process, we have introduced the term “Anchors” to denote them. Given the considerable role these “anchors” fulfill, we find it intuitive to design ICL improvements based on them, as elaborated in § 3. 3 Applications of Our Anchor-Based Understanding With insights from the validated hypothesis, we propose strategies to boost ICL’s accuracy and in- ference speed. We propose an anchor re-weighting method in § 3.1 to adjust the demonstrations’ contri- butions and improve accuracy. In § 3.2, we explore a context compression technique that reduces origi- nal demonstrations to anchor hidden states to speed up ICL inference. Besides, in § 3.3, we utilize an- mation flow. Experimental results with attention manipulation and analysis of predictions correla- tion consolidate the hypothesis holds well in GPT2- XL and GPT-J models. Inspired by the new under- standing perspective, we propose three practical applications. First, an anchor re-weighting method is proposed to improve ICL accuracy. Second, we explore a demonstration compression technique to accelerate ICL inference. Lastly, we showcase an analysis framework to diagnose ICL errors on a real-world dataset. These promising applications again verify the hypothesis and open up new direc- tions for future investigations on ICL. Limitations Our study, while providing valuable insights into in-context learning (ICL), has several limitations. Firstly, our research scope was limited to classi- fication tasks and did not delve into the realm of generative tasks. Additionally, our hypothesis was only examined within conventional ICL paradigms, leaving other ICL paradigms such as the chain of the errors ICL made in real-world scenarios. These approaches corroborate our hypothesis, pointing to potential paths for future ICL enhancements. 3.1 Anchor Re-weighting Based on our analysis in § 2, we draw parallels between ICL and logistic regression and propose an approach to improve ICL’s accuracy by re- weighting label anchors. 3.1.1 Method § 2.3 illustrates a strong correlation between the model’s output category and the attention distri- bution (A (q, p1) , . . . , A(q, pC)) on label words p1, ..., pC of the target position q in deep layers. We can view the attention module as a classifier f, Prf (Y = i|X = x) ≈A(q, pi) = exp(qqkT pi/ √ d)PN j=1 exp(qqkT j / √ d) . (6) By setting qq/ √ d = ˆx and kpi − kpC = βi, we deduce: log Prf (Y = i|X = x) Prf (Y = C|X = x) = βT i ˆx. (7) This approximates a logistic regression model where: log Prf (Y = i|X = x) Prf (Y = C|X = x) = βi 0 + βT i x. (8) In this equation, βi 0 and βT i are parameters that can\n                ---\n                Answer the question based on the above context: How much does the Anchor Re-weighting method improve the performance of vanilla ICL on average?\n                ` does not exist.' type='NotFoundError' param=None code=404

If we find that Hiddenanchor surpasses Textanchor in performance, it solidifies the notion that the ag- gregated information within label words carries significant importance. The Hiddenrandom method is introduced to illustrate that anchor hidden states encapsulate most of the demonstration information among all hidden states. We assess all compression methods using the label loyalty and word loyalty introduced in § 2.2, in addition to classification accuracy. 3.2.3 Results We can see from Table 2 that the proposed com- 3.2.3 Results We can see from Table 2 that the proposed com- pression method Hiddenanchor achieves the best results among all three compression methods on all metrics and for both models. For example, with the GPT-J model, the compression method with anchor states only leads to a 1.5 accuracy drop compared to the uncompressed situation, indicating that the metrics and for both models. For example, with the GPT-J model, the compression method with anchor states only leads to a 1.5 accuracy drop compared to the uncompressed situation, indicating that the compression introduces negligible information loss. Further, we estimate the efficiency improvements over the original ICL. As shown in Table 3, the speed-up ratio ranges from 1.1× to 2.9×, as the efficiency gain is influenced by the length of the demonstrations.

For AGNews, due to the length limit, we only use three demonstrations per class. Our Anchor Re-weighting method achieves the best performance overall tasks. from the demonstrations. Given the auto-regressive nature of GPT-like models, where hidden states of tokens depend solely on preceding ones, label words’ information aggregation process is inde- pendent of subsequent words. This allows for the calculation and caching of the label word hidden states H = {{hi l}C i=1}N l=1 (hi l is the l-th layer’s hidden state of the i-th label word in the demon- stration).

Besides, we observe that the acceleration effect is more pronounced in the GPT-J model compared to GPT2-XL, demonstrating its great potential to apply to larger language models. 3.3 Anchor Distances for Error Diagnosis Lastly, we perform an error analysis for ICL by examining the distances between the key vectors in the attention module that correspond to the label words. 3.3.1 Method Our previous analysis in § 2.3 shows a strong cor- relation between the model output and A(q, pi), which is determined by qqkT pi as per Eq. 7.

We anticipate that the distances between these ˆks can correspond to the category confusion of the model, thus revealing one possible origin of ICL errors. Here, we normal- ize the distances to a scale of 0-1, with 0 indicating the highest degree of category confusion: Confusionpred ij = ∥ ˆkpi − ˆkpj∥ maxs̸=t ∥ ˆkps − ˆkpt∥ , (11) 3.3.2 Experiments We utilize the GPT2-XL model and TREC dataset, as the model displays varying confusion levels be- tween categories on this dataset. We use all 500 samples of the TREC test set and use 1 demonstra- tion per class for convenience of analysis. We calculate the actual model confusion score, Confusionij, between category i and category k us- ing the AUC-ROC metric (detailed in Appendix K). We then compare the predicted confusion score, Confusionpred Table 4: Demonstration templates and label words.

By calculating the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC- ROC) value of this classifier f, we get the degree of confusion between category i and k, termed as Confusionij. The computed Confusionij is a value that never exceeds 1. The closer Confusionij approximates 1, the less pronounced the confusion, and vice versa. We use the above metric instead of directly ana- lyzing the output labels of the model because pre- vious work has indicated the issue of insufficient output probability calibration in ICL (Zhao et al., 2021), which is greatly affected by factors such as sample ordering and model preferences for specific label words. By leveraging our defined degree of confusion, Confusionij, we can implicitly alleviate the disturbances arising from insufficient probabil- ity calibration on the output labels.

The goodwill balance was $1,383 million as of January 28, 2023, of which $891 million was related to the Best Buy Health reporting unit. The Company uses the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the Best Buy Health reporting unit, which requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of cash flows such as revenue growth rates and estimates of the weighted average cost of capital rate.

Compared to fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value in fiscal 2023 decreased approximately in line with the decline in Best Buy’s market capitalization over the same period, reflecting the macroeconomic factors that affected our fiscal year 2023 performance and our expectations for the future. Barring a fundamental, material further deterioration of these factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit is remote.

Open Challenges and Future Directions\nThe advance of agent RL toward general-purpose intelligence hinges on overcoming three pivotal challenges\nthat define the field’s research frontier. First is the challenge ofTrustworthiness: ensuring the reliability,\nsafety, and alignment of increasingly autonomous agents. Second isScaling up Agentic Training, which\nrequires surmounting the immense practical bottlenecks in computation, data, and algorithmic efficiency.\nFinally, an agent’s capabilities are fundamentally bounded by its world, making theScaling up Agentic\nEnvironments, i.e., the creation of complex and adaptive training grounds.\n6.1. Trustworthiness\nSecurity. The security landscape for autonomous agents is fundamentally more complex than for standard\nLLMs. While traditional models are primarily vulnerable to attacks on their text-in, text-out interface,\nagents possess an expanded attack surface due to their external components like tools, memory, and\n\nagents possess an expanded attack surface due to their external components like tools, memory, and\nplanning modules [515, 65]. This architecture exposes them to novel threats beyond direct prompt injection.\nFor instance, indirect prompt injection can occur when an agent interacts with a compromised external\nenvironment, such as a malicious website or API, which poisons its memory or tool outputs [516]. Multi-agent\nsystems further compound these risks by introducing vulnerabilities through inter-agent communication,\nwhere one compromised agent can manipulate or mislead others within the collective [515].\nRL significantly magnifies these agent-specific risks by transforming the agent from a passive victim of\nmanipulation into an active, goal-seeking exploiter of vulnerabilities. The core issue is instrumental goal\nachievement through reward hacking: an RL agent’s primary directive is to maximize its long-term reward,\n\n[350] Zhangxuan Gu, Zhengwen Zeng, Zhenyu Xu, Xingran Zhou, Shuheng Shen, Yunfei Liu, Beitong Zhou,\nChanghua Meng, Tianyu Xia, Weizhi Chen, Yue Wen, Jingya Dou, Fei Tang, Jinzhen Lin, Yulin Liu,\nZhenlin Guo, Yichen Gong, Heng Jia, Changlong Gao, Yuan Guo, Yong Deng, Zhenyu Guo, Liang\nChen, and Weiqiang Wang.

WebArena features fully functional websites across common\ndomains like e-commerce, social forums, collaborative development, and content management systems,\nenriched with utility tools and knowledge bases, and supports multi-tab tasks and user role simulation.\nVisualwebArena extends this by introducing new tasks requiring visual comprehension and a “Set-of-Marks”\n(SoM) representation to annotate interactable elements on screenshots, bridging the gap for multimodal\nweb agents. Additionally, AppWorld [469] constitutes an environment simulating a multi-application ecosys-\ntem, encompassing 9 daily-use applications (e.g., Amazon, Spotify, Gmail) with 457 invokable APIs, and\nconstructing a digital world featuring approximately 100 virtual characters and their social relationships.\n\n5.1.1. Web Environments\nIn the realm of web-based environments, several benchmarks offer controlled yet realistic static environments\nfor Agentic RL. WebShop [464] is a simulated e-commerce website featuring a large catalog of real-world\nproducts and crowd-sourced text instructions. Agents navigate various webpage types and issue diverse\nactions (e.g., searching, selecting items, customizing, purchasing) to find and buy products, with its de-\nterministic search engine aiding reproducibility. Furthermore, Mind2Web [465] is a dataset designed for\ngeneralist web agents, featuring a substantial number of tasks from many real-world websites across diverse\ndomains. It provides webpage snapshots and crowdsourced action sequences for tasks like finding flights or\ninteracting with social profiles, emphasizing generalization across unseen websites and domains.

Open Challenges and Future Directions\nThe advance of agent RL toward general-purpose intelligence hinges on overcoming three pivotal challenges\nthat define the field’s research frontier. First is the challenge ofTrustworthiness: ensuring the reliability,\nsafety, and alignment of increasingly autonomous agents. Second isScaling up Agentic Training, which\nrequires surmounting the immense practical bottlenecks in computation, data, and algorithmic efficiency.\nFinally, an agent’s capabilities are fundamentally bounded by its world, making theScaling up Agentic\nEnvironments, i.e., the creation of complex and adaptive training grounds.\n6.1. Trustworthiness\nSecurity. The security landscape for autonomous agents is fundamentally more complex than for standard\nLLMs. While traditional models are primarily vulnerable to attacks on their text-in, text-out interface,\nagents possess an expanded attack surface due to their external components like tools, memory, and\n\nagents possess an expanded attack surface due to their external components like tools, memory, and\nplanning modules [515, 65]. This architecture exposes them to novel threats beyond direct prompt injection.\nFor instance, indirect prompt injection can occur when an agent interacts with a compromised external\nenvironment, such as a malicious website or API, which poisons its memory or tool outputs [516]. Multi-agent\nsystems further compound these risks by introducing vulnerabilities through inter-agent communication,\nwhere one compromised agent can manipulate or mislead others within the collective [515].\nRL significantly magnifies these agent-specific risks by transforming the agent from a passive victim of\nmanipulation into an active, goal-seeking exploiter of vulnerabilities. The core issue is instrumental goal\nachievement through reward hacking: an RL agent’s primary directive is to maximize its long-term reward,\n\n[350] Zhangxuan Gu, Zhengwen Zeng, Zhenyu Xu, Xingran Zhou, Shuheng Shen, Yunfei Liu, Beitong Zhou,\nChanghua Meng, Tianyu Xia, Weizhi Chen, Yue Wen, Jingya Dou, Fei Tang, Jinzhen Lin, Yulin Liu,\nZhenlin Guo, Yichen Gong, Heng Jia, Changlong Gao, Yuan Guo, Yong Deng, Zhenyu Guo, Liang\nChen, and Weiqiang Wang.
